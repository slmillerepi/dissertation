Influenza A viral strains were considered mismatched by antigenic drift if they were antigenically distinct from influenza A strains contained in the vaccine as per HI typing (for example, HI titer quotient ≥fourfold) or the characterization did not belong to a similar influenza A subtype contained in the vaccine (for example, H1N1 strains circulating but only H3N2 strains contained in the vaccine for bivalent vaccines with one H subtype). For influenza B, the epidemiological situation is more complex. In recent years, there have been two coexisting phylogenetic influenza B lineages: B/Victoria and B/ Yamagata [19,20]. Influenza B strains from infected trial participants were considered matched if the strain belonged to the same lineage and were antigenically similar to the vaccine strain as per HI typing (for example, HI typing quotient &lt;fourfold titer). For influenza B mismatches, two different forms were considered. Mismatch by antigenic drift refers to strains of the same lineage that were antigenically distinct from influenza B strains contained in the vaccine as per HI typing (for example, HI quotient ≥fourfold titer), whereas mismatch by lineage refers to influenza B strains of different lineages. Whenever the influenza B lineage was not presented in the trial report, categorization was based on the influenza phylogenetic tree and verified by influenza experts on the team.”"

Mean age of 46, SD of 10; similar to other groups (Table 1)\n\n\n\nRandomization:\n\nStudy site-specific stratified block randomization with 18-44 and 45-65 age groups\n1:1:1 randomization, receiving ccIIV4, RIV4, or SD-IIV4\n\nSerum collection at d0/enrollment/pre-vax and ~1 month (20-62 days acceptable range) post-vax\nCoprimary outcomes:\n\nSerologic HAI responses at ~1 month post-vax using the following measures:\n\nSeroconversion rate (SCR)\nGeometric mean titers (GMTs)\nMean-fold rise (MFR)\nGMT ratios comparing post-vax HAI titers by study arm vs reference group\n\n\nData analysis:\n\nOnly included those who received SD-IIV4 in season 1\nANOVA to compare GMT ratios, GMTs, and mean fold GMT rise\nLogistic regression to compared rates of SCR and proportions of participatns with postvaccination HAI titers greater than 1:40, 1:80, and 1:160\nModels adjusted for study site, log pre-vax HAI titer\n\nSex, chronic medical conditions, and immunosuppresive conditions also considered but not significant\n\nBonferroni correction led to statistical significance definition at \\(P=0.007\\) and 99.3% CIs\nSensitivity analysis - restricted comparisons to KPNW\n\n390 HCP\n\n103 RIV4\n106 ccIIV4\n109 SD-IIV4\n79 HD-IIV3\n\n“After adjusting for study site and the log of prevaccination HI titers, there were no statistically significant differences in postvaccination SCR, GMT, or MFR against any of the vaccine reference viruses between HD-IIV3 and SD-IIV4 recipients”\n\nInteresting that similar age groups don’t seem to have a larger boost with HD vs SD\n\n“Adjusted postvaccination SCR, GMT, and MFR were significantly higher among ccIIV4 recipients compared with SD-IIV4 recipients against the A/ H1N1pdm09 reference virus only.”\n“CRs, GMTs, and MFRs were significantly higher among RIV4 recipients compared with SD-IIV4 recipients against all vaccine reference viruses.”\n“…higher proportions of RIV4 recipients had titers greater than 1:80 and 1:160 against the A(H1N1) pdm09, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria reference viruses and &gt;1:160 against A(H3N2) [compared to reference group]”\n“There were no differences in the proportions of ccIIV4 compared with SD-IIV4 recipients with titers greater than 1:40, 1:80, or 1:160 for any vaccine reference virus, with the exception of HI titers &gt;1:80 against A/ (H1N1)pdm09.”\n“There were no differences in the proportions of HD-IIV3 and SD-IIV4 recipients with titers greater than 1:40, 1:80, or 1:160 for any vaccine reference virus.”\nSeems like higher response to RIV4 might be driven by recombinant HA antigen rather than higher antigen dose\n\nHigher egg-based antigen dose alonse is not enough to increase responses in highly vaccinated adults 18-65"

Ross\nAuthor we know: Ted M. Ross\nAnimal Model: Ferrets\nSummary:\n\n“Octavalent mixtures of COBRA hemagglutinin (HA) (H1, H2, H3, H5, H7, and influenza B virus) plus neuraminidase (NA) (N1 and N2) recombinant proteins mixed with c-di-AMP adjuvant were administered intranasally to naive or pre-immune ferrets in prime-boost fashion. Four weeks after final vaccination, collected sera were analyzed for breadth of antibody response, and the animals were challenged with seasonal or pre-pandemic strains. The octavalent COBRA vaccine elicited antibodies that recognized a broad panel of strains representing different subtypes, and these vaccinated animals were protected against influenza virus challenges. Overall, this study demonstrated that the mixture of eight COBRA HA/NA proteins mixed with an intranasal adjuvant is a promising candidate for a universal influenza vaccine.”\n\nNotes:\n\n“Ferrets were randomly divided into [four] vaccine groups, and each vaccine group had three different infection groups (n = 4–6). The groups were pre-immune ferrets given octavalent COBRA vaccine, naive ferrets given octavalent COBRA vaccine, pre-immune ferrets given mock vaccine, and naive ferrets given mock vaccine.”\n“For the pre-immune groups, ferrets that had been previously exposed to CA/09 prior to this study were infected with Pan/99 and B/HK/01 60 days prior to vaccination.”\n“Ferrets were boosted 28 days after initial vaccination. Blood was harvested from all anesthetized ferrets via the anterior vena cava prior to vaccination and at days 28 and 56 post-initial vaccination.”\n“On day 56 post-vaccination, ferrets were challenged i.n. with H1N1 Bris/18 (108 PFU), IBV B/WA/19 (107 PFU), or a lethal dose of H5N1 Vn/04 (105 PFU, BSL3 select agent) viruses in a volume of 1 mL (n = 5 per vaccine group per challenge).”\n“Ferrets were monitored daily for weight loss, disease signs, and death for 10 days after infection. Experimental endpoints were defined as &gt;20% wt loss compared to initial body weight. Additionally, dyspnea, lethargy, response to external stimuli, and other respiratory distress were closely monitored for the determination of humane endpoint.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultivalent next generation influenza virus vaccines protect against seasonal and pre-pandemic viruses (Uno and Ross 2024)\n\nFirst/Last Authors: Naoko Uno/Ted M. Ross\nAuthor we know: Ted M. Ross\nAnimal Model: Mouse\nSummary:\n\n“In this study, mice were vaccinated intramuscularly with multiple COBRA HA and NA immunogens in quadrivalent (H1, H3, N1, N2) or heptavalent (H1, H2, H3, H5, H7, N1, N2) regimens formulated with AddaVax™, an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant. These vaccines elicited protective immune responses against a wide breadth of seasonal IAV strains. Heptavalent formulations elicited protective immune responses against a wide breadth of pre-pandemic strains as well. Multivalent COBRA HA and NA proteins are promising candidates for a universal, broadly-reactive influenza vaccine.”\n\nNotes:\n\n“Mice were randomly divided into four vaccine groups (n=44) and each vaccine group had four different infection groups (n=11). The vaccine groups were quadrivalent COBRA formulation, consisting of seasonal components H1 HA (Y2), H3 HA (NG2), N1 NA (N1I), and N2 NA (N2A); heptavalent COBRA formulation, consisting of seasonal Y2, NG2, N1I, N2A along with pandemic components H2 HA (Z1), H5 HA (IAN 8), and H7 HA (Q6); adjuvant only; or negative control. The vaccines were formulated with 3 μg of each recombinant protein or phosphatebuffered saline (PBS, Corning, Tewkbury, MA, USA) and adjuvanted with an emulsified squalene-based oil-inwater emulsion adjuvant, AddaVax™ (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA) at 1:1 ratio.”\n“Vaccines were administered intramuscularly (i.m.) into the hind leg of the animals on day 0, 28, and 56 in a homologous prime-boost-boost regimen. Blood was collected from the facial vein 14 days following each vaccination, on day 14, 42, and 70.”\n“Four weeks after final vaccination, mice were challenged intranasally (i.n.) with 50 μL volume of live influenza virus: lethal dose of Bris/18 (3 × 106 PFU), KS/17 (6 × 106 PFU), MA-Switz/13 (1 × 105 PFU), Mal/MN/08 (1 × 104 PFU), lethal dose of H5N6 Sich/14 (106 PFU), or lethal dose of Anhui/13 (102 PFU, under biosafety level 3 (BSL3) conditions). Following infection, the animals’ body weights were recorded daily, and the animals were monitored twice daily for clinical signs (labored breathing, lethargy, hunched back, ruffled fur, failure to respond to stimuli, and severe respiratory distress) for 14 days. Weight loss more than 25% was used as a primary measurement for determination of humane endpoint. On days 2 or 3 and 6 after infection, three animals from each group were sacrificed, and lungs were collected to assess viral load. Lungs were frozen on dry ice and stored at − 80 °C. Remaining mice (n = 5) were euthanized 14 days after challenge.”"

    "text": "1. Specific Aims\nAim 1. Identify and model correlates of protection against influenza in animal models. Animal models are frequently used in vaccine design and selection. The standard human HAI 50% protective titer (50%PT) of 1:40 is commonly used as an endpoint in these animal models under the assumption that the 50%PTs are equivalent across species. However, there have not been studies to confirm these equivalencies. We will conduct correlates of protection analyses in pre-immune murine and ferret challenge models to assess\nAim 2. Evaluate benefit of high-dose influenza vaccination by estimating and comparing Fluzone vaccine efficacies in age- and dose-based groups. Older adults are now recommended to receive enhanced influenza vaccines, like those with a higher dose, to combat immunosenescence and influenza vulnerabilities. However, the use of these enhanced vaccines have not been assessed in extended cohort studies to determine their true benefit. Using the UGAFluVac immunogenicity data, we will estimate vaccine efficacies in younger adults receiving standard-dose Fluzone vaccines, older adults receiving standard-dose Fluzone vaccines, and older adults receiving high-dose Fluzone vaccines. Using a pre-defined model, we will map HAI titers to protection probabilities and use pre- and post-vaccination protection probabilities to estimate vaccine efficacies. We will then use contrasts to assess the benefit of older adults being given high-dose vaccines.\nAim 3. Quantify the impact of antigenic distance between vaccine and circulating influenza strains on vaccine effectiveness."
