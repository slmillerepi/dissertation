Influenza A viral strains were considered mismatched by antigenic drift if they were antigenically distinct from influenza A strains contained in the vaccine as per HI typing (for example, HI titer quotient ≥fourfold) or the characterization did not belong to a similar influenza A subtype contained in the vaccine (for example, H1N1 strains circulating but only H3N2 strains contained in the vaccine for bivalent vaccines with one H subtype). For influenza B, the epidemiological situation is more complex. In recent years, there have been two coexisting phylogenetic influenza B lineages: B/Victoria and B/ Yamagata [19,20]. Influenza B strains from infected trial participants were considered matched if the strain belonged to the same lineage and were antigenically similar to the vaccine strain as per HI typing (for example, HI typing quotient <fourfold titer). For influenza B mismatches, two different forms were considered. Mismatch by antigenic drift refers to strains of the same lineage that were antigenically distinct from influenza B strains contained in the vaccine as per HI typing (for example, HI quotient ≥fourfold titer), whereas mismatch by lineage refers to influenza B strains of different lineages. Whenever the influenza B lineage was not presented in the trial report, categorization was based on the influenza phylogenetic tree and verified by influenza experts on the team.\"\n:::\n\n## \"Variable influenza vaccine effectiveness by subtype: a systematic review and meta-analysis of test-negative design studies\" [@belongia2016] {#sec-belongia2016}\n\n::: {.notes}\nMatch definition: \"We therefore classified H3N2 viruses as predominately matched, predominately variant, or mixed on the basis of the authors’ interpretation.\"\n:::  \n  \n## \"Prevention of influenza during mismatched seasons in older adults with an MF59-adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine: a randomised, controlled, multicentre, phase 3 efficacy study\" [@beran2021] {#sec-beran2021}\n\n:::{.notes}\nMatch definition: \"Matched strains were those with 4-fold and lower difference in titre and unmatched strains were those with a more than 4-fold difference in titre compared with the reference standards.\"\n:::\n  \n## \"Variable seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness across geographical regions, age groups and levels of vaccine antigenic similarity with circulating virus strains: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence from test-negative design studies after the 2009/10 influenza pandemic\" [@okoli2021a] {#sec-okoli2021a}  \n\n:::{.notes}\nMatch definition: \"gathered match/mismatch variables from the included papers when available and, when not, used other reports for the same general time and region to deduce a general match status\" - had match, partial match, and mismatch, it seems like based on different definitions \n:::\n\n## Another (better) way\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=50%}\n\n- Antigenic distance\n  - A continuous measure of the difference between two strains\n  - Different ways to calculate\n  \n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=50%}\n\n- The idea:\n  - Model VE as predicted by antigenic distance\n  - Gather data from a wide range of years, locations; look at different subtypes\n  - Get a big picture view of the effect of \"mismatch\"\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n## Antigenic Distance Background\n\n## Antigenic Distance Methods \n\n- P-epitope [@gupta2006a; @pan2016]\n\n\n## VE ~ Distance Papers \n\n- \"Quantifying influenza vaccine efficacy and antigenic distance\" [@gupta2006a]\n\n- \"Prediction of influenza B vaccine effectiveness from sequence data\" [@pan2016]\n\n# Proposed Project \n\n## Table 1\n\n```{r}\ntb1_shell |> \n  flextable::autofit() \n```\n## FIgure 1\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=40%}\n\n- Primary modeling result: what is the association between VE and antigenic distance?
