serum HAI taken right before live virus challenge\n  *   Participants came from two different trials, but in both case, challenges were administered 2-3 weeks _after_ completed vaccination (whatever vaccination they may have received)\n  * Serum samples taken both before and (two weeks) after challenge, and nasal swabs for virus isolation were taken 48 hours after challenge \n  * **50% Protective Dose** (PD50) - the titer at which the infection rate is reduced to half the maximum observed rate \n    *   Influenza B: Approximately 1/18 (Infection rate was not much higher in those with no detectable titer than in those with lowest detectable titer - 1/6)\n    * Influenza A: 1/18-1/36 (multiple A studies)\n  * Discussion - specify that this cannot be used to identify a causal relationship, and that HI is often only part of a greater immune response\n    * HI appears to have stronger relationship than NI, but may specifically be less relevant in flu B - not enough data to tell in this study\n    \n    \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../../assets/ref-figs/hobson-fig2.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../../assets/ref-figs/hobson-fig3.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../../assets/ref-figs/hobson-fig6.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Determinants of immunity to influenza infection in man [@potter79]\n\n  * Review \n  * \"Most results indicate that, following immunization with inactivated virus vaccines, HI antibody titres of approximately 1:30-1:40 represent the 50% protective level of antibody (Hobson et al. 1972; Potter et al. 1977a), and similar results have been obtains following live virus infection (McDonald et al. 1962; Andrews et al. 1966).\"\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../../assets/ref-figs/potter-tbl2.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## \"Interpretation of responses and protective levels of antibody against attenuated influenza A viruses using single radial haemolysis\" [@al-khayatt84]\n\n  * 50% PT: 42 for H1N1, 44 for H3N2\n  * \"50% protection against infection of man with H1N1 or H3N2 influenza virus strains\"\n\n\n## \"Correlates of protection to influenza virus, where do we go from here?\" [@cox13]\n\n  * Notes later \n\n## \"Immunological assessment of influenza vaccines and immune correlates of protection\" [@reber13]\n\n  * Notes later \n\n## \"The establishment of surrogates and correlates of protection: Useful tools for the licensure of effective influenza vaccines?\" [@ward18]\n\n  * Notes later \n\n## \"Call for a paradigm shift in the design of universal influenza vaccines by harnessing multiple correlates of protection\" [@jang20]\n\n  * Notes later \n\n## \"Meeting report and review: Immunological assays and correlates of protection for next-generation influenza vaccines\" [@krammer20]\n\n  * Notes later \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Models and Identified CoP Relationships\n\n## \"On the relationship between mean antibody level, seroprotection and clinical protection from influenza\" [@nauta2009a]\n\n  * Modeling/simulations -
