Good correlation between the HI and SRH test was found for both H3N2 and H1N1 antibody and the zone area increases corresponding to significant SRH antibody rises determined for both virus strains. In both H3N2 and H1N1 vaccine studies, intranasal infection of the volunteers with live attenuated viruses was involved and by the measurement of HI and SRH antibodies prior to and following infection, levels of antibody equating with protection against the infecting viruses could be estimated. For the HI test the antibody titres associated with 50\% protection were 42 for H1N1, and 44 for H3N2 viruses; for the SRH test, 50\% protection was associated with zone areas of 20.0-25.0 mm2 for both H1N1 and H3N2 viruses.},

  abstract = {Background Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) can vary by type and subtype. Over the past decade, the test-negative design has emerged as a valid method for estimation of VE. In this design, VE is calculated as 100\%\hphantom{,}×\hphantom{,}(1\hphantom{,}–\hphantom{,}odds ratio) for vaccine receipt in influenza cases versus test-negative controls. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate VE by type and subtype. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed and Embase from Jan 1, 2004, to March 31, 2015. Test-negative design studies of influenza VE were eligible if they enrolled outpatients on the basis of predefined illness criteria, reported subtype-level VE by season, used PCR to confirm influenza, and adjusted for age. We excluded studies restricted to hospitalised patients or special populations, duplicate reports, interim reports superseded by a final report, studies of live-attenuated vaccine, and studies of prepandemic seasonal vaccine against H1N1pdm09. Two reviewers independently assessed titles and abstracts to identify articles for full review. Discrepancies in inclusion and exclusion criteria and VE estimates were adjudicated by consensus. Outcomes were VE against H3N2, H1N1pdm09, H1N1 (pre-2009), and type B. We calculated pooled VE using a random-effects model. Findings We identified 3368 unduplicated publications, selected 142 for full review, and included 56 in the meta-analysis. Pooled VE was 33\% (95\% CI 26–39; I2=44·4) for H3N2, 54\% (46–61; I2=61·3) for type B, 61\% (57–65; I2=0·0) for H1N1pdm09, and 67\% (29–85; I2=57·6) for H1N1; VE was 73\% (61–81; I2=31·4) for monovalent vaccine against H1N1pdm09. VE against H3N2 for antigenically matched viruses was 33\% (22–43; I2=56·1) and for variant viruses was 23\% (2–40; I2=55·6). Among older adults (aged {$>$}60 years), pooled VE was 24\% (−6 to 45; I2=17·6) for H3N2, 63\% (33–79; I2=0·0) for type B, and 62\% (36–78; I2=0·0) for H1N1pdm09. Interpretation Influenza vaccines provided substantial protection against H1N1pdm09, H1N1 (pre-2009), and type B, and reduced protection against H3N2. Vaccine improvements are needed to generate greater protection against H3N2 than with current vaccines. Funding None.},

Neither seasonal nor challenge-based correlates have been evaluated in children.           Methods:~           A total of 4707 influenza vaccine–naive healthy children 6 to 72 months old were randomized in a ratio of 2:2:1 to receive 2 doses of MF-59–adjuvanted influenza vaccine (Novartis Vaccines), trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine subunit (trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine control, GSK), or a saline placebo during the 2007 to 2008 and 2008 to 2009 influenza seasons. The second dose was given 30 days after dose 1. Clinical influenza-like illnesses cases identified by active surveillance were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing for influenza. Vaccine immunogenicity 50 days after dose 1 was evaluated in a subset of 777 children.           Results:~           Immunogenicity and efficacy results for H3N2 were evaluated against the Prentice criteria, which confirmed that the immunogenicity results warranted estimation of an immunologic correlate. We then used the Dunning model fitting the H3N2 antibody titers at day 50 and the influenza cases observed in the immunogenicity subset to estimate a correlate of protection. This analysis revealed that a cutoff HI titer of 1:110 was associated with the conventional 50\% clinical protection rate against infection during the entire season, and titers of 1:215, 1:330, and 1:629 predicated protection rates of 70\%, 80\%, and 90\%, respectively. The conventional adult HI titer of 1:40 was only associated with 22\% protection.           Conclusions:~           The use of the 1:40 HI adult correlate of protection is not appropriate when evaluating influenza vaccines in children. Although a cutoff of 1:110 may be used to predict the conventional 50\% clinical protection rate, a titer of 1:330 would predict an 80\% protective level, which would seem to be more desirable from a public health perspective.},

  abstract = {Immunocompromised individuals are at high risk of severe illness and complications from influenza infection. For this reason, immunization using inactivated influenza vaccines is recommended for transplant patients, individuals receiving immunosuppressant treatments, and other persons with immunodeficiency. However, these immunocompromised populations are more likely to have lower and nonprotective responses to annual vaccination with a standard influenza vaccine. Here, we review strategies aimed to improve the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in immunocompromised populations. The different strategies employed have included adjuvanted vaccines, high-dose vaccines, booster doses, intradermal vaccination, and temporary discontinuation of immunosuppressant treatment regimens. High-dose trivalent, inactivated, split-virus influenza vaccine (IIV3-HD) is so far one of the leading strategies for improving vaccine responses in HIV patients, transplant patients, and persons receiving immunosuppressant therapies for inflammatory diseases. Several studies in these populations have shown stronger humoral responses with IIV3-HD than existing standard-dose trivalent vaccine, and comparable safety. Accordingly, some scientific societies have stated that high-dose influenza vaccine could be a preferred option for immunocompromised patients. However, larger randomized controlled studies are needed to validate relative immunogenicity and safety of IIV3-HD and other enhanced vaccines and vaccination strategies in immunocompromised individuals.},

The authors reviewed published studies describing the course of influenza virus infection in placebo-treated and untreated volunteers challenged with wild-type influenza virus. A total of 56 different studies with 1,280 healthy participants were considered. Viral shedding increased sharply between 0.5 and 1 day after challenge and consistently peaked on day 2. The duration of viral shedding averaged over 375 participants was 4.80 days (95\% confidence interval: 4.31, 5.29). The frequency of symptomatic infection was 66.9\% (95\% confidence interval: 58.3, 74.5). Fever was observed in 37.0\% of A/H1N1, 40.6\% of A/H3N2 (p = 0.86), and 7.5\% of B infections (p = 0.001). The total symptoms scores increased on day 1 and peaked on day 3. Systemic symptoms peaked on day 2. No such data exist for children or elderly subjects, but epidemiologic studies suggest that the natural history might differ. The present analysis confirms prior expert opinion on the duration of viral shedding or the frequency of asymptomatic influenza infection, extends prior knowledge on the dynamics of viral shedding and symptoms, and provides original results on the frequency of respiratory symptoms or fever.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-dose (HD) influenza vaccine offers improved protection from influenza virus infection among older adults compared with standard-dose (SD) vaccine. Here, we explored whether HD vaccine attenuates disease severity among older adults with breakthrough influenza. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of US claims data for influenza seasons 2016-2017, 2017-2018, and 2018-2019, defined as 1 October through 30 April, among adults aged ≥65 years. After adjusting the different cohorts for the probability of vaccination conditional on patients' characteristics, we compared 30-day mortality rate post-influenza among older adults who experienced breakthrough infection after receipt of HD or SD influenza vaccines and among those not vaccinated (NV). RESULTS: We evaluated 44 456 influenza cases: 23 109 (52\%) were unvaccinated, 15 037 (33.8\%) received HD vaccine, and 6310 (14.2\%) received SD vaccine. Significant reductions in mortality rates among breakthrough cases were observed across all 3 seasons for HD vs NV, ranging from 17\% to 29\% reductions. A significant mortality reduction of 25\% was associated with SD vaccination vs NV in the 2016-2017 season when there was a good match between circulating influenza viruses and selected vaccine strains. When comparing HD vs SD cohorts, mortality reductions were higher among those who received HD in the last 2 seasons when mismatch between vaccine strains and circulating H3N2 viruses was documented, albeit not significant. CONCLUSIONS: HD vaccination was associated with lower post-influenza mortality among older adults with breakthrough influenza, even during seasons when antigenically drifted H3N2 circulated. Improved understanding of the impact of different vaccines on attenuating disease severity is warranted when assessing vaccine policy recommendations.},

However, due to its ability to rapidly evolve, the SARS-CoV-2 virus may never be eradicated, and there are many important new topics to work on if we need to live with this virus for a long time. To this end, we hope to provide essential knowledge for researchers who work on the improvement of future COVID-19 vaccines.

An HI titre of 1:40 is generally accepted to correspond to a 50\% reduction in the risk of contracting influenza in a susceptible population, but limited attempts have been made to further quantify the association between HI titre and protective efficacy.We present a model, using a meta-analytical approach, that estimates the level of clinical protection against influenza at any HI titre level. Source data were derived from a systematic literature review that identified 15 studies, representing a total of 5899 adult subjects and 1304 influenza cases with interval-censored information on HI titre. The parameters of the relationship between HI titre and clinical protection were estimated using Bayesian inference with a consideration of random effects and censorship in the available information.A significant and positive relationship between HI titre and clinical protection against influenza was observed in all tested models. This relationship was found to be similar irrespective of the type of viral strain (A or B) and the vaccination status of the individuals.Although limitations in the data used should not be overlooked, the relationship derived in this analysis provides a means to predict the efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccines when only immunogenicity data are available. This relationship can also be useful for comparing the efficacy of different influenza vaccines based on their immunological profile.},

  abstract = {BackgroundDespite their pivotal role in the assessment of influenza vaccines, limited attempts have been made to use hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers for predicting vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed influenza. We present here the second step of a two-step approach allowing performing such predictions and use it to compare a new trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine administered by the intradermal (ID) route (INTANZA®/IDFlU®) with the vaccine administered by the classical intramuscular (IM) route.ResultsPooling all available immunogenicity data, the predicted vaccine efficacy was 63.3\% [CI: 58.1; 68.7] for ID route and 54.4\% [CI: 49.4; 59.2] for IM route. The corresponding relative increase in efficacy was 16.5\% [CI: 12.7; 20.1]. Predicted vaccine efficacies decreased with age for both vaccines, but the decrease was less marked by ID route: the relative increase in efficacy for subjects aged 70 years and above is of 18.0\% [CI:12;24]:MethodsThe first step corresponding to the estimation of the level of protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza that can be linked to each HI titer, referred to as the HI protection curve, was achieved by using a meta-analytical approach based on published information. Vaccine efficacy and differences in vaccine efficacy are predicted in a second step using this HI protection curve alongside the results of two randomized clinical trials providing comparative information on the immunogenicity of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines administered ID or IM in 3,503 \& 1,645 elderly participants, respectively.ConclusionThe analysis performed confirmed that the superior immune response provided by the vaccine using the ID route should translate into a higher vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed influenza.},

  abstract = {Background. The relationship between seasonal influenza vaccine and susceptibility to 2009 pandemic A/H1N1 virus infection is not fully understood. Methods. One child 6–15 years of age from each of 119 households was randomized to receive 1 dose of inactivated trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine (TIV) or saline placebo in November 2008. Serum samples were collected from study subjects and their household contacts before and 1 month after vaccination (December 2008), after winter (April 2009) and summer influenza (September–October 2009) seasons. Seasonal and pandemic influenza were confirmed by serum hemagglutinination inhibition, viral neutralization titers, and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction performed on nasal and throat swab samples collected during illness episodes. Results. TIV recipients had lower rates of serologically confirmed seasonal A/H1N1 infection (TIV group, 8\%; placebo group, 21\%; P p .10) and A/H3N2 infection (7\% vs 12\%; P p .49), but higher rates of pandemic A/ H1N1 infection (32\% vs 17\%; P p .09). In multivariable analysis, those infected with seasonal influenza A during the study had a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 infection (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.35; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.14–0.87), and receipt of seasonal TIV was unassociated with risk of pandemic A/ H1N1 infection (adjusted OR, 1.11; 95\% CI, 0.54–2.26). Conclusions. TIV protected against strain-matched infection in children. Seasonal influenza infection appeared to confer cross-protection against pandemic influenza. Whether prior seasonal influenza vaccination affects the risk of infection with the pandemic strain requires additional study.},

However, information on the cumulative incidence of infection in specific epidemics is scarce, and there are limited studies with sufficient follow-up to identify the strength and duration of protection against reinfection. METHODS: We randomly allocated children 5-17 years of age to receive trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or placebo from September 2009 through January 2010, and then conducted follow-up for 3 years including regular collection of sera, symptom diaries, and collection of nose and throat swabs during illness episodes in participants or their household members. RESULTS: Of 796 children initially randomized, 484 continued to participate for all 3 years. In unvaccinated children, cumulative incidence of infection was estimated to be 59\% in the first wave of H1N1pdm09 in 2009-2010, and 7\%, 14\%, 20\%, and 31\% in subsequent epidemics of H3N2 (2010), H1N1pdm09 (2011), B (2012), and H3N2 (2012), respectively. Infection with H1N1pdm09 in 2009-2010 and H3N2 in 2010 was associated with protection against infection with subsequent epidemics of the same subtype in 2011 and 2012, respectively, but we found no evidence of heterotypic or heterosubtypic protection against infection. CONCLUSIONS: We identified substantial incidence of influenza virus infections in children in Hong Kong in 5 major epidemics over a 3-year period, and evidence of homosubtypic but not heterosubtypic protection following infection.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational study to evaluate the effects of maternally transferred antibodies against influenza A and B viruses against laboratory-confirmed influenza in a cohort born over 24 months. Cord blood samples were retrieved at birth and infants were actively followed for the first 6 months of life. Nasal swabs were collected and tested for influenza A and B by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction whenever an illness episode was identified. Cord blood samples were tested by the hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay to viruses that circulated during the follow-up period. RESULTS: 1162 infants were born to 1140 recruited women: 1092 (94\%) infants completed 6 months of follow-up. Proportions of cord blood with HAI antibody titers \textbackslash geq40 against A(H1N1), A(H3N2), B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata were 31\%, 24\%, 31\%, and 54\%, respectively. Only 4\% of women had maternal influenza vaccination. Cord blood antigen-specific HAI titers \textbackslash geq40 were found to correlate with protection from infection only for influenza B/Yamagata. No influenza B virus infection occurred in infants \textbackslash leq60 days old. Proportional hazards analysis showed that a cord blood HAI titer of 40 was associated with 83\% (95\% confidence interval, 44-95\%) reduction in the risk of influenza B/Yamagata infections compared with a cord blood titer {$<$}10. CONCLUSIONS: We documented that maternal immunity against influenza B/Yamagata was conferred to infants within the first 6 months of life.},

However, the proportion of vaccine-induced protection that is mediated by the post-vaccination HAI titer has not been assessed.We used data from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of a split-virion inactivated influenza vaccine in children aged 6–17 years.

We fitted Cox proportional hazards models to the time to laboratory-confirmed influenza B. We used causal mediation analysis to estimate the proportion of the total effect of vaccination that was mediated by higher HAI titers.We estimated that vaccine efficacy against confirmed B/Victoria infection was 68\% (95\% confidence interval, 33\%, 88\%), and post-vaccination HAI titers explained 57\% of the effect of vaccination on protection.The majority of the effect of inactivated influenza vaccination in children is mediated by the increased HAI titer after vaccination; however, other components of the immune response to vaccination may also play a role in protection and should be further explored. Causal mediation analysis provides a framework to quantify the role of various mediators of protection.},

  abstract = {Enhanced influenza vaccines may improve protection for older adults, but comparative immunogenicity data are limited. Our objective was to examine immune responses to enhanced influenza vaccines, compared to standard-dose vaccines, in community-dwelling older adults.Community-dwelling older adults aged 65–82 years in Hong Kong were randomly allocated (October 2017–January 2018) to receive 2017–2018 Northern hemisphere formulations of a standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine, MF59-adjuvanted trivalent vaccine, high-dose trivalent vaccine, or recombinant-hemagglutinin (rHA) quadrivalent vaccine. Sera collected from 200 recipients of each vaccine before and at 30-days postvaccination were assessed for antibodies to egg-propagated vaccine strains by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and to cell-propagated A/Hong Kong/4801/2014(H3N2) virus by microneutralization (MN). Influenza-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were assessed in 20 participants per group.Mean fold rises (MFR) in HAI titers to egg-propagated A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) and the MFR in MN to cell-propagated A(H3N2) were statistically significantly higher in the enhanced vaccine groups, compared to the standard-dose vaccine. The MFR in MN to cell-propagated A(H3N2) was highest among rHA recipients (4.7), followed by high-dose (3.4) and MF59-adjuvanted (2.9) recipients, compared to standard-dose recipients (2.3). Similarly, the ratio of postvaccination MN titers among rHA recipients to cell-propagated A(H3N2) recipients was 2.57-fold higher than the standard-dose vaccine, which was statistically higher than the high-dose (1.33-fold) and MF59-adjuvanted (1.43-fold) recipient ratios. Enhanced vaccines also resulted in the boosting of T-cell responses.In this head-to-head comparison, older adults receiving enhanced vaccines showed improved humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, compared to standard-dose vaccine recipients.NCT03330132.},

The regulatory authorities currently annually license vaccines based on serum antibodies directed toward the major surface glycoprotein haemagglutinin (HA). The most commonly used serological test, the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay utilizes red blood cells, which show considerable biological variation. There is a need for validated, standardized assays to reduce laboratory variation steps that are currently being taken by the regulatory agencies. Here we examine the historical evidence for defining the HI titer ≥ 40 as a surrogate correlate of protection and examine alternative assays. Moreover, the immune response to influenza is multifacated and there are probably multiple correlates of protection. We conclude there is a need for detailed immunological analysis including kinetic studies and head to head comparison of vaccines by a range of immunological assays to further define correlates of protection.},

In this study, influenza B vaccine mismatches and clinical aspects of Victoria and Yamagata infections in Brazil were assessed. Clinical samples were collected from patients suspected of influenza infection. In addition, sociodemographic, clinical, and epidemiological information were collected by the epidemiological surveillance teams. Influenza B lineages were determined by real-time RT-PCR and/or Sanger sequencing. In addition, putative phylogeny–trait associations were assessed by using the BaTS program after phylogenetic reconstruction by a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (BEAST software package). Over 2010–2020, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata-like lineages co-circulated in almost all seasonal epidemics, with B/Victoria predominance in most years. Vaccine mismatches between circulating viruses and the trivalent vaccine strains occurred in five of the eleven seasons (45.5\%). No significant differences were identified in clinical presentation or disease severity caused by both strains, but subjects infected by B/Victoria-like viruses were significantly younger than their B/Yamagata-like counterparts (16.7 vs. 31.4 years, p {$<$} 0.001). This study contributes to a better understanding of the circulation patterns and clinical outcomes of B/Victoria- and B/Yamagata-like lineages in Brazil and advocate for the inclusion of a quadrivalent vaccine in the scope of the Brazilian National Immunization Program.},

  abstract = {Immune imprinting is a driver known to shape the anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody landscape of individuals born within the same birth cohort. With the HA and neuraminidase (NA) proteins evolving at different rates under immune selection pressures, anti-HA and anti-NA antibody responses since childhood influenza virus infections have not been evaluated in parallel at the individual level. This is partly due to the limited knowledge of changes in NA antigenicity, as seasonal influenza vaccines have focused on generating neutralizing anti-HA antibodies against HA antigenic variants. Here, we systematically characterized the NA antigenic variants of seasonal A(H1N1) viruses from 1977 to 1991 and completed the antigenic profile of N1 NAs from 1977 to 2015. We identified that NA proteins of A/USSR/90/77, A/Singapore/06/86, and A/Texas/36/91 were antigenically distinct and mapped N386K as a key determinant of the NA antigenic change from A/USSR/90/77 to A/Singapore/06/86. With comprehensive panels of HA and NA antigenic variants of A(H1N1) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, we determined hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) and neuraminidase inhibition (NI) antibodies from 130 subjects born between 1950 and 2015. Age-dependent imprinting was observed for both anti-HA and anti-NA antibodies, with the peak HI and NI titers predominantly detected from subjects at 4 to 12\,years old during the year of initial virus isolation, except the age-independent anti-HA antibody response against A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. More participants possessed antibodies that reacted to multiple antigenically distinct NA proteins than those with antibodies that reacted to multiple antigenically distinct HA proteins. Our results support the need to include NA proteins in seasonal influenza vaccine preparations. IMPORTANCE Seasonal influenza vaccines have aimed to generate neutralizing anti-HA antibodies for protection since licensure. More recently, anti-NA antibodies have been established as an additional correlate of protection. While HA and NA antigenic changes occurred discordantly, the anti-HA and anti-NA antibody profiles have rarely been analyzed in parallel at the individual level, due to the limited knowledge on NA antigenic changes. By characterizing NA antigenic changes of A(H1N1) viruses, we determined the anti-HA and anti-NA antibody landscape against antigenically distinct A(H1N1) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses using sera of 130 subjects born between 1950 and 2015. We observed age-dependent imprinting of both anti-HA and anti-NA antibodies against strains circulated during the first decade of life. A total of 67.7\% (88/130) and 90\% (117/130) of participants developed cross-reactive antibodies to multiple HA and NA antigens at titers ≥1:40. With slower NA antigenic changes and cross-reactive anti-NA antibody responses, including NA protein in influenza vaccine preparation may enhance vaccine efficacy.},

The vaccine antigen, the viral spike protein hemagglutinin (HA), tends to elicit strain-specific neutralizing activity, predicting that sequential immunization with the same HA strain will boost antibodies with narrow coverage. However, repeated vaccination with homologous SARS-CoV-2 vaccine eventually elicits neutralizing activity against highly unmatched variants, questioning this immunological premise. We evaluated a longitudinal influenza vaccine cohort, where each year the subjects received the same, novel H1N1 2009 pandemic vaccine strain. Repeated vaccination gradually enhanced receptor-blocking antibodies (HAI) to highly unmatched H1N1 strains within individuals with no initial memory recall against these historical viruses. An in silico model of affinity maturation in germinal centers integrated with a model of differentiation and expansion of memory cells provides insight into the mechanisms underlying these results and shows how repeated exposure to the same immunogen can broaden the antibody response against diversified targets.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Vaccine efficacy is often assessed by counting disease cases in a clinical trial. A new quantitative framework proposed here (“PoDBAY,” Probability of Disease Bayesian Analysis), estimates vaccine efficacy (and confidence interval) using immune response biomarker data collected shortly after vaccination. Given a biomarker associated with protection, PoDBAY describes the relationship between biomarker and probability of disease as a sigmoid probability of disease (“PoD”) curve. The PoDBAY framework is illustrated using clinical trial simulations and with data for influenza, zoster, and dengue virus vaccines. The simulations demonstrate that PoDBAY efficacy estimation (which integrates the PoD and biomarker data), can be accurate and more precise than the standard (case-count) estimation, contributing to more sensitive and specific decisions than threshold-based correlate of protection or case-count-based methods. For all three vaccine examples, the PoD fit indicates a substantial association between the biomarkers and protection, and efficacy estimated by PoDBAY from relatively little immunogenicity data is predictive of the standard estimate of efficacy, demonstrating how PoDBAY can provide early assessments of vaccine efficacy. Methods like PoDBAY can help accelerate and economize vaccine development using an immunological predictor of protection. For example, in the current effort against the COVID-19 pandemic it might provide information to help prioritize (rank) candidates both earlier in a trial and earlier in development.},

High assay values are often associated with protection from disease. A question of interest is how the relationship between assay values and subsequent development of disease should be quantitatively modelled. Existing approaches successfully model the relationship for high assay values, where the probability of developing disease is low. However at low assay values, the probability of developing disease is more closely associated with factors such as disease prevalence rates and an individual's chance of exposure to infection; these are less well captured by existing models. This paper presents a model that accommodates both assay values and factors independent of assay values, enabling protection from disease to be modelled over the whole range of assay values and proposing a method for predicting the efficacy of a vaccine from the assays of vaccinees and non-vaccinees.},

A recent vaccine efficacy trial comparing standard-dose with high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine in persons 65 years of age and older provided the opportunity to examine the relationship between values of three immunologic assays and protection against community-acquired A/H3N2 influenza illness. The high-dose vaccine induced significantly higher antibody titers than the standard-dose vaccine for all assays. For the hemagglutination inhibition assay, a titer of 40 was found to correspond with 50\% protection when the assay virus was antigenically well matched to the circulating virus--the same titer as is generally recognized for 50\% protection in younger adults. A dramatically higher titer was required for 50\% protection when the assay virus was a poor match to the circulating virus. With the well-matched virus, some protection was seen at the lowest titers; with the poorly matched virus, high levels of protection were not achieved even at the highest titers. Strong associations were also seen between virus neutralization test titers and protection, but reliable estimates for 50\% protection were not obtained. An association was seen between titers of an enzyme-linked lectin assay for antineuraminidase N2 antibodies and protection; in particular, the proportion of treatment effect explained by assay titer in models that included both this assay and one of the other assays was consistently higher than in models that included either assay alone.

We included testing of ‘future’ isolates that circulated after sample collection. We show that immunological biases are conferred by early life IBV infection and result in lineage-specific cross-reactivity of a birth cohort towards future IBV isolates. This translates into differential estimates of susceptibility between birth cohorts towards the B/Yamagata and B/Victoria lineages, predicting lineage-specific birth-cohort distributions of observed medically attended IBV infections. Our data suggest that immunological measurements of imprinting could be important in modelling and predicting virus epidemiology.},

  abstract = {Correlates of protection (CoP) are biological parameters that predict a certain level of protection against an infectious disease. Well-established correlates of protection facilitate the development and licensing of vaccines by assessing protective efficacy without the need to expose clinical trial participants to the infectious agent against which the vaccine aims to protect. Despite the fact that viruses have many features in common, correlates of protection can vary considerably amongst the same virus family and even amongst a same virus depending on the infection phase that is under consideration. Moreover, the complex interplay between the various immune cell populations that interact during infection and the high degree of genetic variation of certain pathogens, renders the identification of immune correlates of protection difficult. Some emerging and re-emerging viruses of high consequence for public health such as SARS-CoV-2, Nipah virus (NiV) and Ebola virus (EBOV) are especially challenging with regards to the identification of CoP since these pathogens have been shown to dysregulate the immune response during infection. Whereas, virus neutralising antibodies and polyfunctional T-cell responses have been shown to correlate with certain levels of protection against SARS-CoV-2, EBOV and NiV, other effector mechanisms of immunity play important roles in shaping the immune response against these pathogens, which in turn might serve as alternative correlates of protection. This review describes the different components of the adaptive and innate immune system that are activated during SARS-CoV-2, EBOV and NiV infections and that may contribute to protection and virus clearance. Overall, we highlight the immune signatures that are associated with protection against these pathogens in humans and could be used as CoP.},

Phase I and II clinical trials have assessed safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of inactivated influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccines. A shortage of vaccine is likely to occur during the first months of a pandemic. Hence, determining whether to give one dose to more people or two doses to fewer people to best protect the population is essential. We use hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titers as an immune correlate for avian influenza vaccines. Using an established relationship to obtain a theoretical vaccine efficacy from immunogenicity data from thirteen arms of six phase I and phase II clinical trials of inactivated influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccines, we assessed: (1) the proportion of theoretical vaccine efficacy achieved after a single dose (defined as primary response level), and (2) whether theoretical efficacy increases after a second dose, with and without adjuvant. Participants receiving vaccine with AS03 adjuvant had higher primary response levels (range: 0.48-0.57) compared to participants receiving vaccine with MF59 adjuvant (range: 0.32-0.47), with no observed trends in primary response levels by antigen dosage. After the first and second doses, vaccine with AS03 at dosage levels 3.75, 7.5 and 15mcg had the highest estimated theoretical vaccine efficacy: Dose (1) 45\% (95\% CI: 36-57\%), 53\% (95\% CI: 42-63\%) and 55\% (95\% CI: 44-64\%), respectively and Dose (2) 93\% (95\% CI: 89-96\%), 97\% (95\% CI: 95-98\%) and 97\% (95\% CI: 96-100\%), respectively. On average, the estimated theoretical vaccine efficacy of lower dose adjuvanted vaccines (AS03 and MF59) was 17\% higher than that of higher dose unadjuvanted vaccines, suggesting that including an adjuvant is dose-sparing. These data indicate adjuvanted inactivated influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccine produces high theoretical efficacy after two doses to protect individuals against a potential avian influenza pandemic.},

Therefore, in this article we discuss the potential for a weighted average of age-specific VE estimates to provide a more meaningful measure of overall VE. We illustrate this perspective first using simulations to evaluate how overall VE would be biased when certain age groups are overrepresented. We found that unweighted overall VE estimates tended to be higher than weighted VE estimates when children were overrepresented and lower when elderly persons were overrepresented. Then we extracted published estimates from the US Flu VE network, in which children are overrepresented, and some discrepancy between unweighted and weighted overall VE was observed. Differences in weighted versus unweighted overall VE estimates could translate to substantial differences in the interpretation of individual risk reduction among vaccinated persons and in the total averted disease burden at the population level. Weighting of overall estimates should be considered in VE studies in the future.},

  abstract = {Seasonal influenza is a primary public health burden in the USA and globally. Annual vaccination programs are designed on the basis of circulating influenza viral strains. However, the effectiveness of the seasonal influenza vaccine is highly variable between seasons and among individuals. A number of factors are known to influence vaccination effectiveness including age, sex, and comorbidities. Here, we sought to determine whether whole blood gene expression profiling prior to vaccination is informative about pre-existing immunological status and the immunological response to vaccine. We performed whole transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of whole blood samples obtained prior to vaccination from 275 participants enrolled in an annual influenza vaccine trial. Serological status prior to vaccination and 28 days following vaccination was assessed using the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) to define baseline immune status and the response to vaccination. We find evidence that genes with immunological functions are increased in expression in individuals with higher pre-existing immunity and in those individuals who mount a greater response to vaccination. Using a random forest model, we find that this set of genes can be used to predict vaccine response with a performance similar to a model that incorporates physiological and prior vaccination status alone. A model using both gene expression and physiological factors has the greatest predictive power demonstrating the potential utility of molecular profiling for enhancing prediction of vaccine response. Moreover, expression of genes that are associated with enhanced vaccination response may point to additional biological pathways that contribute to mounting a robust immunological response to the seasonal influenza vaccine.},

We used baseline and convalescent antibody titres measured by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and viral neutralization (VN) assays against influenza A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and B viruses to investigate the characteristics of antibody rises following virologically confirmed influenza virus infections in participants in a community-based study. Multivariate models were fitted in a Bayesian framework to characterize the distribution of changes in antibody titres following influenza A virus infections. In 122 participants with PCR-confirmed influenza A virus infection, homologous antibody titres rose by geometric means of 1\textbackslash cdot2- to 10\textbackslash cdot2-fold after infection with A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09. Significant cross-reactions were observed between A(H1N1)pdm09 and seasonal A(H1N1). Antibody titre rises for some subtypes and assays varied by age, receipt of oseltamivir treatment, and recent receipt of influenza vaccination. In conclusion, we provided a quantitative description of the mean and variation in rises in influenza virus antibody titres following influenza virus infection. The multivariate patterns in boosting of antibody titres following influenza virus infection could be taken into account to improve estimates of cumulative incidence of infection in seroepidemiological studies.},

The relative contribution ratio of each transmission route is largely undetermined, which is affected by environmental conditions, human behaviour, the host and the microorganism. In this study, a detailed mathematical model is developed to investigate the relative contributions of different transmission routes to a multi-route transmitted respiratory infection. The following transmission routes are considered: long-range airborne transmission, short-range airborne transmission, direction inhalation of medium droplets or droplet nuclei, direct deposition of droplets of all sizes, direct and indirect contact route. It is illustrated that all transmission routes can dominate the total transmission risk under different scenarios. Influential parameters considered include the dose-response rate of different routes, droplet governing size that determines pathogen content in droplets, exposure distance, and pathogen dose transported to the hand of infector. Our multi-route transmission model provided a comprehensive but straightforward method to evaluate the probability of respiratory diseases transmission via different routes. It also established a basis for predicting the impact of individual-level intervention methods such as increasing close-contact distance and wearing protective masks.},

Using this problem of evaluating an immunological surrogate as an illustration, we describe a hierarchy of three criteria for a valid surrogate endpoint and statistical analysis frameworks for evaluating them. Based on a placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy trial, the first level entails assessing the correlation of an immune response with a study endpoint in the study groups, and the second level entails evaluating an immune response as a surrogate for the study endpoint that can be used for predicting vaccine efficacy for a setting similar to that of the vaccine trial. We show that baseline covariates, innovative study design, and a potential outcomes formulation can be helpful for this assessment. The third level entails validation of a surrogate endpoint via meta-analysis, where the goal is to evaluate how well the immune response can be used to predict vaccine efficacy for new settings (building bridges). A simulated vaccine trial and two example vaccine trials are presented, one supporting that certain anti-influenza antibody levels are an excellent surrogate for influenza illness and another supporting that certain anti-HIV antibody levels are not useful as a surrogate for HIV infection.},

Since influenza vaccines are frequently reformulated, monitoring VE changes is crucial. Traditional efficacy trials are costly and time-consuming, but immunogenicity studies using hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers—a reliable correlate of protection—can be used to estimate VE more efficiently.We analyzed data from a human vaccine cohort who received either the SD or HD Fluzone split-inactivated influenza vaccine during influenza seasons 2013–2014 to 2021–2022. We used a previously developed statistical model to map pre- and postvaccination HAI titers to protection probabilities, and computed differences in VE of the HD vaccine in older (≥65 years) populations compared to SD vaccines in the same age group and in younger (\&lt;65 years) adults.We found that the HD vaccine generally improved the estimated VE in older adults. We also found that HD recipients often had a lower estimated VE than younger SD recipients.While HD vaccines lead to a small increase in estimated VE compared to SD in older adults, further increases in dose or other developments to improve VE should be considered.},

Two active, prospective, population-based surveillance systems were established for monitoring influenza and other respiratory pathogens among those hospitalized patients with acute respiratory illness and those enrolled patients seeking consultations at sentinel general practices. In 2015, a sero-epidemiological study will use a sample of patients from the same practices. These data will provide a full picture of the disease burden and risk factors from asymptomatic infections to severe hospitalized disease and deaths and related economic burden. The results during the first 2~years (2012-2013) provided scientific evidence to (a) support a change to NZ's vaccination policy for young children due to high influenza hospitalizations in these children; (b) contribute to the revision of the World Health Organization's case definition for severe acute respiratory illness for global influenza surveillance; and (c) contribute in part to vaccine strain selection using vaccine effectiveness assessment in the prevention of influenza-related consultations and hospitalizations. In summary, SHIVERS provides valuable international platforms for supporting seasonal influenza control and pandemic preparedness, and responding to other emerging/endemic respiratory-related infections.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: New Zealand's (NZ) complete absence of community transmission of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) after May 2020, likely due to COVID-19 elimination measures, provided a rare opportunity to assess the impact of border restrictions on common respiratory viral infections over the ensuing 2\,years. METHODS: We collected the data from multiple surveillance systems, including hospital-based severe acute respiratory infection surveillance, SHIVERS-II, -III and -IV community cohorts for acute respiratory infection (ARI) surveillance, HealthStat sentinel general practice (GP) based influenza-like illness surveillance and SHIVERS-V sentinel GP-based ARI surveillance, SHIVERS-V traveller ARI surveillance and laboratory-based surveillance. We described the data on influenza, RSV and other respiratory viral infections in NZ before, during and after various stages of the COVID related border restrictions. RESULTS: We observed that border closure to most people, and mandatory government-managed isolation and quarantine on arrival for those allowed to enter, appeared to be effective in keeping influenza and RSV infections out of the NZ community. Border restrictions did not affect community transmission of other respiratory viruses such as rhinovirus and parainfluenza virus type-1. Partial border relaxations through quarantine-free travel with Australia and other countries were quickly followed by importation of RSV in 2021 and influenza in 2022. CONCLUSION: Our findings inform future pandemic preparedness and strategies to model and manage the impact of influenza and other respiratory viral threats.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza virus infections are associated with a wide spectrum of disease. However, few studies have investigated in detail the epidemiological and virological characteristics of asymptomatic and mild illness with influenza virus infections. METHODS: In a community-based study in Hong Kong from 2008 to 2014, we followed up initially healthy individuals who were household contacts of symptomatic persons with laboratory-confirmed influenza, to identify secondary infections. Information from daily symptom diaries was used to classify infections as symptomatic (\textbackslash geq2 signs/symptoms, including fever \textbackslash geq37.8° C, headache, myalgia, cough, sore throat, runny nose and sputum), paucisymptomatic (1 symptom only), or asymptomatic (none of these symptoms). We compared the patterns of influenza viral shedding between these groups. RESULTS: We identified 235 virologically confirmed secondary cases of influenza virus infection in the household setting, including 31 (13\%) paucisymptomatic and 25 (11\%) asymptomatic cases. The duration of viral RNA shedding was shorter and declined more rapidly in paucisymptomatic and asymptomatic than in symptomatic cases. The mean levels of influenza viral RNA shedding in asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic cases were approximately 1-2 log10 copies lower than in symptomatic cases. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of influenza viral shedding in patients with influenza who have very few or no symptoms reflects their potential for transmitting the virus to close contacts. These findings suggest that further research is needed to investigate the contribution of persons with asymptomatic or clinically mild influenza virus infections to influenza virus transmission in household, institutional, and community settings.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The genetic variability and diversity of influenza viruses, and the expansion of their hosts, present a significant threat to human health. The development of a universal influenza vaccine is urgently needed to tackle seasonal epidemics, pandemics, vaccine mismatch, and zoonotic transmissions to humans. AREAS COVERED: Despite the identification of broadly neutralizing antibodies against influenza viruses, designing a universal influenza vaccine that induces such broadly neutralizing antibodies at protective levels in humans has remained challenging. Besides neutralizing antibodies, multiple correlates of protection have recently emerged as crucially important for eliciting broad protection against diverse influenza viruses. This review discusses the immune responses required for broad protection against influenza viruses, and suggests a paradigm shift from an HA stalk-based approach to other approaches that can induce multiple immunological correlates of protection for the development of a universal influenza vaccine. EXPERT OPINION: To develop a truly universal influenza vaccine, multiple correlates of protection should be considered, including antibody responses and T cell immunity. Balanced induction of neutralizing antibodies, antibody effector functions, and T cell immunity will contribute to the most effective vaccination strategy. Live-attenuated influenza vaccines provide an attractive platform to improve the breadth and potency of vaccines for broader protection.},

  abstract = {We are in the midst of a pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than two million deaths after one year of the pandemic. The world is experiencing a deep economic recession. Safe and effective vaccines are needed to prevent further morbidity and mortality. Vaccine candidates against COVID-19 have been developed at an unprecedented speed, with more than 200 vaccine candidates currently under investigation. Among those, 20 candidates have entered the clinical Phase 3 to evaluate efficacy, and three have been approved by the European Medicines Agency. The aim of immunization is to act against infection, disease and/or transmission. However, the measurement of vaccine efficacy is challenging, as efficacy trials need to include large cohorts with verum and placebo cohorts. In the future, this will be even more challenging as further vaccine candidates will receive approval, an increasing number of humans will receive vaccinations and incidence might decrease. To evaluate novel and second-generation vaccine candidates, randomized placebo-controlled trials might not be appropriate anymore. Correlates of protection (CoP) could be an important tool to evaluate novel vaccine candidates, but vaccine-induced CoP have not been clearly defined for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. In this review, we report on immunogenicity against natural SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccine-induced immune responses and discuss immunological markers that can be linked to protection. By discussing the immunogenicity and efficacy of forerunner vaccines, we aim to give a comprehensive overview of possible efficacy measures and CoP.},

METHODS: In a community-based study in Hong Kong in 2008, we followed up initially healthy individuals to quantify trends in viral shedding on the basis of cultures and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) through the course of illness associated with seasonal influenza A and B virus infection. RESULTS: Trends in symptom scores more closely matched changes in molecular viral loads measured with RT-PCR for influenza A than for influenza B. For influenza A virus infections, the replicating viral loads determined with cultures decreased to undetectable levels earlier after illness onset than did molecular viral loads. Most viral shedding occurred during the first 2-3 days after illness onset, and we estimated that 1\%-8\% of infectiousness occurs prior to illness onset. Only 14\% of infections with detectable shedding at RT-PCR were asymptomatic, and viral shedding was low in these cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that "silent spreaders" (ie, individuals who are infectious while asymptomatic or presymptomatic) may be less important in the spread of influenza epidemics than previously thought.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccine efficacy/effectiveness can vary from season to season due in part to the dominant circulating strains and antigenic matching. This study reviews the relative vaccine efficacy/effectiveness (rVE) of high-dose inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (HD-IIV3) compared to standard-dose influenza vaccines (SD-IIV) in adults aged~≥~65~years against influenza-associated outcomes. Additional sub-analyses of HD-IIV3 rVE were performed by the predominantly circulating influenza strain and the antigenic match or mismatch of the vaccine against the predominant circulating strains. METHODS: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted for studies assessing the rVE of HD-IIV3 against probable/laboratory-confirmed influenza-like illness (ILI), hospital admissions, and death in adults aged~≥~65~years. Results from individual seasons were extracted from the studies, and viral surveillance data were used to determine the dominant circulating strains and antigenic match for each season. Results were then stratified based on clinical outcomes and seasonal characteristics and meta-analyzed to estimate pooled rVEs of HD-IIV3. RESULTS: 15 publications were meta-analyzed after screening 1,293 studies, providing data on 10 consecutive influenza seasons and over 22 million individuals receiving HD-IIV3 in randomized and observational settings. Across all influenza seasons, HD-IIV3 demonstrated improved protection against ILI compared to SD-IIV (rVE~=~15.9\%, 95\% CI: 4.1-26.3\%). HD-IIV3 was also more effective at preventing hospital admissions from all-causes (rVE~=~8.4\%, 95\% CI: 5.7-11.0\%), as well as influenza (rVE~=~11.7\%, 95\% CI: 7.0-16.1\%), pneumonia (rVE~=~27.3\%, 95\% CI: 15.3-37.6\%), combined pneumonia/influenza (rVE~=~13.4\%, 95\% CI: 7.3-19.2\%) and cardiorespiratory events (rVE~=~17.9\%, 95\% CI: 15.0-20.8\%). Reductions in mortality due to pneumonia/influenza (rVE~=~39.9\%, 95\% CI: 18.6-55.6\%) and cardiorespiratory causes (rVE~=~27.7\%, 95\% CI: 13.2-32.0\%) were also observed. Similar pooled rVEs were observed in both matched and mismatched seasons and in seasons where A/H3N2 or A/H1N1 strains were predominantly circulating. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence over 10 consecutive influenza seasons and in more than 34 million individuals aged~≥~65~years suggests that HD-IIV3 is consistently more effective than SD-IIV at reducing influenza cases as well as influenza-associated clinical complications irrespective of circulating strain and antigenic match.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The fraction of persons with influenza virus infection, who do not report any signs or symptoms throughout the course of infection is referred to as the asymptomatic fraction. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published estimates of the asymptomatic fraction of influenza virus infections. We found that estimates of the asymptomatic fraction were reported from two different types of studies: first, outbreak investigations with short-term follow-up of potentially exposed persons and virologic confirmation of infections; second, studies conducted across epidemics typically evaluating rates of acute respiratory illness among persons with serologic evidence of infection, in some cases adjusting for background rates of illness from other causes. RESULTS: Most point estimates from studies of outbreak investigations fell in the range 4\%-28\% with low heterogeneity (I = 0\%) with a pooled mean of 16\% (95\% confidence interval = 13\%, 19\%). Estimates from the studies conducted across epidemics without adjustment were very heterogeneous (point estimates 0\%-100\%; I = 97\%), while estimates from studies that adjusted for background illnesses were more consistent with point estimates in the range 65\%-85\% and moderate heterogeneity (I = 58\%). Variation in estimates could be partially explained by differences in study design and analysis, and inclusion of mild symptomatic illnesses as asymptomatic in some studies. CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of the asymptomatic fraction are affected by the study design, and the definitions of infection and symptomatic illness. Considerable differences between the asymptomatic fraction of infections confirmed by virologic versus serologic testing may indicate fundamental differences in the interpretation of these two indicators.},

We aimed to compare the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses of the high-dose (HD) and the standard-dose (SD) trivalent inactivated vaccine. METHODS: We collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells pre- and postimmunization from 60 patients enrolled in a randomized trial of HD versus SD vaccine (30 HD; 30 SD) during the 2016-2017 influenza season. RESULTS: The HD vaccine elicited significantly greater monofunctional and polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses against influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B. For example, median vaccine-elicited influenza-specific polyfunctional CD4+ T cells were higher in recipients of the HD than SD vaccine after stimulation with influenza A/H1N1 (1193 vs 0 per 106 CD4+ T cells; P = .003), A/H3N2 (1154 vs 51; P = .008), and B (1102 vs 0; P = .001). Likewise, vaccine-elicited influenza-specific polyfunctional CD8+ T cells were higher in recipients of the HD than SD vaccine after stimulation with influenza B (367 vs 0; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides novel evidence that HD vaccine elicits greater cellular responses compared with the SD vaccine in SOT recipients, which provides support to preferentially consider use of HD vaccination in the SOT setting.},

  abstract = {There is increasing attention to the need to identify new immune markers for the evaluation of existing and new influenza vaccines. Immune markers that could predict individual protection against infection and disease, commonly called correlates of protection (CoPs), play an important role in vaccine development and licensing. Here, we discuss the epidemiologic considerations when evaluating immune markers as potential CoPs for influenza vaccines and emphasize the distinction between correlation and causation. While an immune marker that correlates well with protection from infection can be used as a predictor of vaccine efficacy, it should be distinguished from an immune marker that plays a mechanistic role in conferring protection against a clinical endpoint—the latter might be a more reliable predictor of vaccine efficacy and a more appropriate target for rational vaccine design. To clearly distinguish mechanistic and nonmechanistic CoPs, we suggest using the term “correlates of protection” for nonmechanistic CoPs, and ‘‘mediators of protection’’ for mechanistic CoPs. Furthermore, because the interactions among and relative importance of correlates or mediators of protection can vary according to age or prior vaccine experience, the effect sizes and thresholds for protective effects for CoPs could also vary in different segments of the population.},

Using causal mediation analysis, we quantified the proportion of vaccine efficacy mediated by post-vaccination HAI titers.Causal mediation analyses were conducted using data collected for a randomized, active-comparator controlled, phase 3 trial of a candidate inactivated, split-virion seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) in children aged 3 to 8 years conducted from October 2010 to December 2011 in eight countries. Vaccine efficacy was estimated with a weighted Cox proportional hazards regression model. Estimates were decomposed into the direct and indirect effects mediated by post-vaccination HAI titers.The proportions of vaccine efficacy mediated by post-vaccination HAI titers were estimated to be 22\% (95\% CI: 18\%, 47\%) for influenza A(H1N1), 20\% (95\% CI: 16\%, 39\%) for influenza A(H3N2), and 37\% (95\% CI: 26\%, 85\%) for influenza B/Victoria.HAI titers partially mediate influenza vaccine efficacy against influenza A(H1N1), A(H3N2), and B/Victoria. Our estimates were lower than previous studies, possibly reflecting expected heterogeneity in antigenic similarity between vaccine and circulating viruses across seasons. Data from more influenza seasons are needed to understand better the mediating effects of HAI titers on vaccine efficacy.},

This review aims to identify how rVE evaluation is being performed in studies of influenza to inform a more standardized approach. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search on PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science for studies reporting rVE comparing vaccine components, dose, or vaccination schedules. We screened titles, abstracts, full texts, and references to identify relevant articles. We extracted information on the study design, relative comparison made, and the definition and statistical approach used to estimate rVE in each study. RESULTS: We identified 63 articles assessing rVE in influenza virus. Studies compared multiple vaccine components (n = 38), two or more doses of the same vaccine (n = 17), or vaccination timing or history (n = 9). One study compared a range of vaccine components and doses. Nearly two-thirds of all studies controlled for age, and nearly half for comorbidities, region, and sex. Assessment of 12 studies presenting both absolute and relative effect estimates suggested proportionality in the effects, resulting in implications for the interpretation of rVE effects. CONCLUSIONS: Approaches to rVE evaluation in practice is highly varied, with improvements in reporting required in many cases. Extensive consideration of methodologic issues relating to rVE is needed, including the stability of estimates and the impact of confounding structure on the validity of rVE estimates.},

However, few studies have resolved the contribution of cellular responses within the context of preexisting antibody titers. Here, we measured the peripheral immune profiles of 206 vaccinated or unvaccinated adults to determine how baseline variations in the cellular and humoral immune compartments contribute independently or synergistically to the risk of developing symptomatic influenza. Protection correlated with diverse and polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T, circulating T follicular helper, T helper type 17, myeloid dendritic and CD16+ natural killer (NK) cell subsets. Conversely, increased susceptibility was predominantly attributed to nonspecific inflammatory populations, including γδ T cells and activated CD16− NK cells, as well as TNFα+ single-cytokine-producing CD8+ T cells. Multivariate and predictive modeling indicated that cellular subsets (1) work synergistically with humoral immunity to confer protection, (2) improve model performance over demographic and serologic factors alone and (3) comprise the most important predictive covariates. Together, these results demonstrate that preinfection peripheral cell composition improves the prediction of symptomatic influenza susceptibility over vaccination, demographics or serology alone.},

We compared antibody responses to high-dose egg-based inactivated (HD-IIV3), recombinant (RIV4), and cell culture–based (ccIIV4) vs standard-dose egg-based inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) among health care personnel (HCP) aged 18–65 years in 2 influenza seasons (2018–2019, 2019–2020).In the second trial season, newly and re-enrolled HCPs who received SD-IIV4 in season 1 were randomized to receive RIV4, ccIIV4, or SD-IIV4 or were enrolled in an off-label, nonrandomized arm to receive HD-IIV3. Prevaccination and 1-month-postvaccination sera were tested by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay against 4 cell culture propagated vaccine reference viruses. Primary outcomes, adjusted for study site and baseline HI titer, were seroconversion rate (SCR), geometric mean titers (GMTs), mean fold rise (MFR), and GMT ratios that compared vaccine groups to SD-IIV4.Among 390 HCP in the per-protocol population, 79 received HD-IIV3, 103 RIV4, 106 ccIIV4, and 102 SD-IIV4. HD-IIV3 recipients had similar postvaccination antibody titers compared with SD-IIV4 recipients, whereas RIV4 recipients had significantly higher 1-month-postvaccination antibody titers against vaccine reference viruses for all outcomes.HD-IIV3 did not induce higher antibody responses than SD-IIV4, but, consistent with previous studies, RIV4 was associated with higher postvaccination antibody titers. These findings suggest that recombinant vaccines rather than vaccines with higher egg-based antigen doses may provide improved antibody responses in highly vaccinated populations.},

RESULTS: Participants who reported receipt of vaccination during either of the previous 2 years had a lower mean fold rise against all strains than with those who did not.

Questions have been raised about its use as a surrogate for vaccine efficacy, particularly with regard to an absolute titer indicating seroprotection. METHODS: We examined hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) antibody titers in subjects from a placebo-controlled trial of inactivated and live attenuated vaccines and compared titers in subjects with symptomatic influenza (cases) to those without influenza infection (noncases). RESULTS: Prevaccination and postvaccination geometric mean titers were both significantly lower for cases compared with noncases in all intervention groups. Frequency of postvaccination seroconversion did not significantly differ for cases and noncases in either vaccine group. Among live attenuated vaccine and placebo recipients, cases were less likely than noncases to have postvaccination HAI titers ≥32 or 64. Nearly all recipients of inactivated vaccine had postvaccination titers of at least 64, and the small number of vaccine failures were scattered across titers ranging from 64 to 2048. CONCLUSIONS: While HAI antibody is the major correlate of protection, postvaccination titers alone should not be used as a surrogate for vaccine efficacy. Vaccine failures from clinical trials need to be examined to determine why seemingly protective HAI titers may not protect. Clinical Trials Registration. NCT00538512.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a recognized need to determine influenza vaccine effectiveness on an annual basis and a long history of studying respiratory illnesses in households. METHODS: We recruited 328 households with 1441 members, including 839 children, and followed them during the 2010-2011 influenza season. Specimens were collected from subjects with reported acute respiratory illnesses and tested by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Receipt of influenza vaccine was defined based on documented evidence of vaccination in medical records or an immunization registry. The effectiveness of 2010-2011 influenza vaccination in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza was estimated using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age and presence of high-risk condition, and stratified by prior season (2009-2010) vaccination status. RESULTS: Influenza was identified in 78 (24\%) households and 125 (9\%) individuals; the infection risk was 8.5\% in the vaccinated and 8.9\% in the unvaccinated (P = .83). Adjusted vaccine effectiveness in preventing community-acquired influenza was 31\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], -7\% to 55\%). In vaccinated subjects with no evidence of prior season vaccination, significant protection (62\% [95\% CI, 17\%-82\%]) against community-acquired influenza was demonstrated. Substantially lower effectiveness was noted among subjects who were vaccinated in both the current and prior season. There was no evidence that vaccination prevented household transmission once influenza was introduced; adults were at particular risk despite vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine effectiveness estimates were lower than those demonstrated in other observational studies carried out during the same season. The unexpected findings of lower effectiveness with repeated vaccination and no protection given household exposure require further study.},

  abstract = {Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness that causes significant human morbidity and mortality, affecting 5–15\% of the population in a typical epidemic season. Human influenza epidemics are caused by types A and B, with roughly 25\% of human cases due to influenza B. Influenza B is a single-stranded RNA virus with a high mutation rate, and both prior immune history and vaccination put significant pressure on the virus to evolve. Due to the high rate of viral evolution, the influenza B vaccine component of the annual influenza vaccine is updated, roughly every other year in recent years. To predict when an update to the vaccine is needed, an estimate of expected vaccine effectiveness against a range of viral strains is required. We here introduce a method to measure antigenic distance between the influenza B vaccine and circulating viral strains. The measure correlates well with effectiveness of the influenza B component of the annual vaccine in humans between 1979 and 2014. We discuss how this measure of antigenic distance may be used in the context of annual influenza vaccine design and prediction of vaccine effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Background: High-dose (HD) influenza vaccine, currently the most commonly used vaccine among US seniors (aged ! 65 years), has been shown to be more efficacious than standard-dose (SD) vaccine in multiple randomized trials. This study evaluated the real-world relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of HD vs SD over four influenza seasons. Methods: This study included Medicare Fee-for-Service enrollees who received HD or SD at an outpatient clinic or pharmacy during influenza seasons 2011–2012 through 2014–2015. Probable influenza (an inpatient stay with an influenza diagnosis on the claim, or an outpatient visit with a rapid influenza test/culture followed by an antiviral prescription) was assessed among HD recipients matched 1:1 with SD recipients by location, vaccination date, age, and sex. Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard models with competing risk of death were used to adjust for residual confounding. Analyses were stratified by outpatient vs pharmacy vaccination. Results: Across the four influenza seasons, there were 535,598, 1,017,552, 1,548,164, and 2,420,450 in the pharmacy cohort; and 821,662, 1,151,080, 1,559,488, and 2,421,758 in the outpatient cohort. During peak influenza season, rVEs for 2011–12 through 2014–15 were 21.8\% (95\% CI: À5.9\%, 42.3\%), 14.8\% (9.3\%, 19.9\%), 16.9\% (9.2\%, 23.9\%), and 17.2\% (14.5\%, 19.9\%), respectively, in the pharmacy cohort; and 16.5\% (À5.9\%, 34.2\%), 15.1\% (10.9\%, 19.1\%), 10.0\% (2.9\%, 16.6\%), and À0.2\% (À3.0\%, 2.5\%), respectively, in the outpatient cohort. Conclusion: HD was consistently associated with better protection against probable influenza. The lower treatment effect observed in the outpatient cohort could reflect provider bias due to physicians triaging HD to frailer patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antigenically drifted A(H3N2) viruses circulated extensively during the 2014-2015 influenza season. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was low and not significant among outpatients but in a hospitalized population was 43\%. At least one study paradoxically observed increased A(H3N2) infection among those vaccinated 3 consecutive years. METHODS: We followed a cohort of 1341 individuals from 340 households. VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza was estimated. Hemagglutination-inhibition and neuraminidase-inhibition antibody titers were determined in subjects ≥13 years. RESULTS: Influenza A(H3N2) was identified in 166 (12\%) individuals and B(Yamagata) in 34 (2\%). VE against A(H3N2) was -3\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: -55\%, 32\%) and similarly ineffective between age groups; increased risk of infection was not observed among those vaccinated in 2 or 3 previous years. VE against influenza B(Yamagata) was 57\% (95\% CI: -3\%, 82\%) but only significantly protective in children {$<$}9 years (87\% [95\% CI: 43\%, 97\%]). Less than 20\% of older children and adults had ≥4-fold antibody titer rise against influenza A(H3N2) and B antigens following vaccination; responses were surprisingly similar for antigens included in the vaccine and those similar to circulating viruses. Antibody against A/Hong Kong/4801/14, similar to circulating 2014-2015 A(H3N2) viruses and included in the 2016-2017 vaccine, did not significantly predict protection. CONCLUSIONS: Absence of VE against A(H3N2) was consistent with circulation of antigenically drifted viruses; however, generally limited antibody response following vaccination is concerning even in the context of antigenic mismatch. Although 2014-2015 vaccines were not effective in preventing A(H3N2) infection, no increased susceptibility was detected among the repeatedly vaccinated.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aimed to estimate the protection afforded by inactivated influenza vaccine, in both community and hospital settings, in a well characterised urban population in Auckland during 2014. METHODS: We used two different comparison groups, all patients who tested negative for influenza and only those patients who tested negative for influenza and had a non-influenza respiratory virus detected, to calculate the vaccine effectiveness in a test negative study design. Estimates were made separately for general practice outpatient consultations and hospitalised patients, stratified by age group and by influenza type and subtype. Vaccine status was confirmed by electronic record for general practice patients and all respiratory viruses were detected by real time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: 1039 hospitalised and 1154 general practice outpatient consultations met all the study inclusion criteria and had a respiratory sample tested for influenza and other respiratory viruses. Compared to general practice patients, hospitalised patients were more likely to be very young or very old, to be Māori or Pacific Islander, to have a low income and to suffer from chronic disease. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) adjusted for age and other participant characteristics using all influenza negative controls was 42\% (95\% CI: 16 to 60\%) for hospitalised and 56\% (95\% CI: 35 to 70\%) for general practice patients. The vaccine appeared to be most effective against the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strain with an adjusted VE of 62\% (95\% CI:38 to 77\%) for hospitalised and 59\% (95\% CI:36 to 74\%) for general practice patients, using influenza virus negative controls. Similar results found when patients testing positive for a non-influenza respiratory virus were used as the control group. CONCLUSION: This study contributes to validation of the test negative design and confirms that inactivated influenza vaccines continue to provide modest but significant protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza.},

Although mucosal and cellular immune responses are clearly important to protection by some vaccines, most vaccines licensed today depend for their efficacy on serum antibodies. Particular levels of antibodies can be identified that confer protection most of the time. A condition for the efficacy of antibodies is functionality, i.e. their ability to kill or inactivate pathogens.

There may be {$>$}1 correlate of protection for a disease, which we term "cocorrelates." Either effector or central memory may correlate with protection. Cell-mediated immunity also may operate as a correlate or cocorrelate of protection against disease, rather than against infection. In situations where the true correlate of protection is unknown or difficult to measure, surrogate tests (usually antibody measurements) must suffice as predictors of protection by vaccines.

A CoP is a marker of immune function that statistically correlates with protection after vaccination that may be either an mCoP, which is a mechanistic cause of protection, or an nCoP, which does not cause protection but nevertheless predicts protection through its (partial) correlation with another immune response(s) that mechanistically protects.},

To characterize virus variants that achieve sustainable transmission in new hosts, we examined within-host virus genetic diversity in household donor-recipient pairs from the first wave of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic when seasonal H3N2 was co-circulating. Although the same variants were found in multiple members of the community, the relative frequencies of variants fluctuated, with patterns of genetic variation more similar within than between households. We estimated the effective population size of influenza A virus across donor-recipient pairs to be approximately 100-200 contributing members, which enabled the transmission of multiple lineages, including antigenic variants.},

  abstract = {We investigated risk factors for severe acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) among hospitalised children {$<$}2 years, with a focus on the interactions between virus and age. Statistical interactions between age and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, adenovirus (ADV) and rhinovirus on the risk of ALRI outcomes were investigated. Of 1780 hospitalisations, 228 (12.8\%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The median (range) length of stay (LOS) in hospital was 3 (1–27) days. An increase of 1 month of age was associated with a decreased risk of ICU admission (rate ratio (RR) 0.94; 95\% confidence intervals (CI) 0.91–0.98) and with a decrease in LOS (RR 0.96; 95\% CI 0.95–0.97). Associations between RSV, influenza, ADV positivity and ICU admission and LOS were significantly modified by age. Children {$<$}5 months old were at the highest risk from RSV-associated severe outcomes, while children {$>$}8 months were at greater risk from influenza-associated ICU admissions and long hospital stay. Children with ADV had increased LOS across all ages. In the first 2 years of life, the effects of different viruses on ALRI severity varies with age. Our findings help to identify specific ages that would most benefit from virus-specific interventions such as vaccines and antivirals.},

  abstract = {Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is increasingly recognized as an important cause of illness in adults; however, data on RSV disease and economic burden in this age group remain limited. We aimed to provide comprehensive estimates of RSV disease burden among adults aged ≥18 years. Methods During 2012–2015, population-based, active surveillance of acute respiratory infection (ARI) hospitalizations enabled estimation of the seasonal incidence of RSV hospitalizations and direct health costs in adults aged ≥18 years in Auckland, New Zealand. Results Of 4,600 ARI hospitalizations tested for RSV, 348 (7.6\%) were RSV positive. The median (interquartile range) length of hospital stay for RSV positive patients was 4 (2–6) days. The seasonal incidence rate (IR) of RSV hospitalizations, corrected for non-testing, was 23.6 (95\% confidence intervals [CI] 21.0–26.1) per 100,000 adults aged ≥18 years. Hospitalization risk increased with age with the highest incidence among adults aged ≥80 years (IR 190.8 per 100,000, 95\% CI 137.6–244.0). Being of Māori or Pacific ethnicity or living in a neighborhood with low socioeconomic status (SES) were independently associated with increased RSV hospitalization rates. We estimate RSV-associated hospitalizations among adults aged ≥18 years to cost on average NZD \$4,758 per event. Conclusions RSV infection is associated with considerable disease and economic cost in adults. RSV disproportionally affects adult sub-groups defined by age, ethnicity, and neighborhood SES. An effective RSV vaccine or RSV treatment may offer benefits for older adults.},

  abstract = {Influenza A viruses evolve rapidly to escape host immunity, causing reinfection. The form and duration of protection after each influenza virus infection are poorly understood. We quantify the dynamics of protective immunity by fitting individual-level mechanistic models to longitudinal serology from children and adults. We find that most protection in children but not adults correlates with antibody titers to the hemagglutinin surface protein. Protection against circulating strains wanes to half of peak levels 3.5-7 years after infection in both age groups, and wanes faster against influenza A(H3N2) than A(H1N1)pdm09. Protection against H3N2 lasts longer in adults than in children. Our results suggest that influenza antibody responses shift focus with age from the mutable hemagglutinin head to other epitopes, consistent with the theory of original antigenic sin, and might affect protection. Imprinting, or primary infection with a subtype, has modest to no effect on the risk of non-medically attended infections in adults.},

  abstract = {Influenza vaccines remain the primary public health tool in reducing the ever-present burden of influenza and its complications. In seeking more immunogenic, more effective and more broadly cross-protective influenza vaccines, the landscape of influenza vaccines is rapidly expanding, both in near-term advances and next-generation vaccine design. Although the first influenza vaccines were licensed over 60 years ago, the hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titer is currently the only universally accepted immune correlate of protection against influenza. However, hemagglutination-inhibition titers appear to be less effective at predicting protection in populations at high risk for severe influenza disease; older adults, young children and those with certain medical conditions. The lack of knowledge and validated methods to measure alternate immune markers of protection against influenza remain a substantial barrier to the development of more immunogenic, broadly cross-reactive and effective influenza vaccines. Here, the authors review the knowledge of immune effectors of protection against influenza and discuss assessment methods for a broader range of immunological parameters that could be considered in the evaluation of traditional or new-generation influenza vaccines.},

  abstract = {Background: The availability of high-dose (HD) influenza vaccine for seniors should decrease influenzarelated hospitalization. Studies to date show a range of mostly moderate increased HD vaccine effectiveness (VE). While a ‘healthy vaccinee’ phenomenon can inflate VE, for influenza and particularly an HD vaccine targeted at frailer adults, an ‘at-risk vaccinee’ bias may deflate VE estimates. We assessed senior HD vaccine effectiveness against influenza-related hospitalization by linking immunization registry records to hospitalizations. We also examined whether adding strata typically ignored in case-control matching schemas, such as residence areas, exact age, and provider biases, would increase VE. Methods: For the 2016–17 influenza season in the Portland metropolitan area, the differential VE for the HD vaccine in preventing PCR-confirmed influenza hospitalization was assessed by a nested series of models across matching strata. For an exact match for high-dose and standard-dose seniors, matching elements included exact age, gender, residence type, race-ethnicity, provider bias, and residence area (zipcode). Results: As a first step, a simple aggregate comparison of influenza-related hospitalization risk showed no added HD effectiveness. For the nested models, adding strata increased VE. In the final model, among 23,712 matched pairs of HD to SD vaccinated seniors, the HD vaccine was 30.7\% (95\%CI: 8–48\%) more effective in preventing influenza-related hospitalization. Conclusion: For this study, the high-dose influenza vaccine provided superior protection for seniors against influenza hospitalization. Including matching elements as exact year of age and residence zipcode all added to the calculation of VE. As a warning, non-matched or overly simple matched VE study designs may substantially under-estimate VE.},

  abstract = {At the start of the 2019–2020 influenza season, concern arose that circulating B/Victoria viruses of the globally emerging clade V1A.3 were antigenically drifted from the strain included in the vaccine. Intense B/Victoria activity was followed by circulation of genetically diverse A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses that were also antigenically drifted. We measured vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the United States against illness from these emerging viruses.We enrolled outpatients aged ≥6 months with acute respiratory illness at 5 sites. Respiratory specimens were tested for influenza by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Using the test-negative design, we determined influenza VE by virus subtype/lineage and genetic subclades by comparing odds of vaccination in influenza cases versus test-negative controls.Among 8845 enrollees, 2722 (31\%) tested positive for influenza, including 1209 (44\%) for B/Victoria and 1405 (51\%) for A(H1N1)pdm09. Effectiveness against any influenza illness was 39\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 32–44), 45\% (95\% CI: 37–52) against B/Victoria and 30\% (95\% CI: 21–39) against A(H1N1)pdm09-associated illness. Vaccination offered no protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses with antigenically drifted clade 6B.1A 183P-5A+156K HA genes (VE 7\%; 95\% CI: –14 to 23\%) which predominated after January.Vaccination provided protection against influenza illness, mainly due to infections from B/Victoria viruses. Vaccine protection against illness from A(H1N1)pdm09 was lower than historically observed effectiveness of 40\%–60\%, due to late-season vaccine mismatch following emergence of antigenically drifted viruses. The effect of drift on vaccine protection is not easy to predict and, even in drifted years, significant protection can be observed.},

METHODS: The Southern Hemisphere Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness Research and Surveillance (SHIVERS) project enrolled adults (aged\,≥\,18\,years) with acute respiratory illness (ARI) in general ward (GW) hospital settings (n\,=\,3034) and ICUs (n\,=\,101) during 2012-2015. IVE was assessed using a test-negative design comparing the odds of influenza vaccination among influenza positives vs. negatives (confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). All models were adjusted for season, weeks from season peak, and a vaccination propensity score. RESULTS: Influenza virus infection was confirmed in 28\% of GW hospital and 41\% of ICU patients; influenza vaccination was documented for 56\% and 41\%, respectively. Across seasons, IVE was 37\% (95\% confidence intervals [CI]\,=\,23-48\%) among GW patients and 82\% (95\% CI\,=\,45-94\%) among ICU patients. IVE point estimates were\,{$>$}\,70\% against ICU influenza and consistently higher than IVE against GW influenza when stratified by season, by virus (sub)types, and for adults with or without chronic medical conditions and for both adults aged {$<$}65 and ≥65\,years old. Among hospitalized influenza positives, influenza vaccination was associated with a 59\% reduction in the odds of ICU admission (aOR\,=\,0.41, 95\% CI\,=\,0.18-0.96) and with shorter ICU lengths of stay (LOS), but not with radiograph-confirmed pneumonia or GW hospital LOS. CONCLUSION: Inactivated influenza vaccines prevented influenza-associated ICU admissions, may have higher effectiveness in ICU than GW hospital settings, and appeared to reduce the risk of severe disease among those who are infected despite vaccination.},

  abstract = {Influenza illness is caused by influenza A and influenza B strains. Although influenza A viruses are perceived to carry greater risk because they account for the majority of influenza cases in most seasons and have been responsible for influenza pandemics, influenza B viruses also impose a substantial public health burden, particularly among children and at-risk subjects. , Furthermore, since the 2001-2002 influenza season, both influenza B lineages, B/Victoria-like viruses and B/Yamagata-like viruses have co-circulated in Europe., The conventional trivalent influenza vaccines have shown a limited ability to induce effective protection when major or minor mismatches between the influenza B vaccine component and circulating strains occur. For this reason, the inclusion of a second B strain in influenza vaccines may help to overcome the well-known difficulties of predicting the circulating B lineage and choosing the influenza B vaccine component., Two quadrivalent influenza vaccines, a live-attenuated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Q/LAIV) and a split inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (I/QIV), were first licensed in the US in 2012. Since their introduction, models simulating the inclusion of QIV in influenza immunization programs have demonstrated the substantial health benefits, in terms of reducing the number of influenza cases, their complications and mortality., In the near future, evaluations from simulation models should be confirmed by effectiveness studies in the field, and more costeffectiveness analyses should be conducted in order to verify the expected benefits.},

Previous studies have established that antibody titer measured by the hemagglutination-inhibiting (HAI) assay is correlated with protection against influenza virus infection, with an HAI titer of 1:40 generally associated with 50\% protection. Methods. We recruited index cases with confirmed influenza virus infection from outpatient clinics, and followed up their household contacts for 7–10 days to identify secondary infections. Serum samples collected from a subset of household contacts were tested by HAI and microneutralization (MN) assays against prevalent influenza viruses. We analyzed the data using an individual hazard-based transmission model that adjusted for age and vaccination history. Results. Compared to a reference group with antibody titers {$<$}1:10, we found that HAI titers of 1:40 against influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) were associated with 31\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 13\%–46\%) and 31\% (CI, 1\%–53\%) protection against polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–confirmed A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) virus infection, respectively, while an MN titer of 1:40 against A(H3N2) was associated with 49\% (95\% CI, 7\%–81\%) protection against PCR-confirmed A(H3N2) virus infection. Conclusions. An HAI titer of 1:40 was associated with substantially less than 50\% protection against PCRconfirmed influenza virus infection within households, perhaps because of exposures of greater duration or intensity in that confined setting.},

Viral shedding is used as a proxy measure of infectivity in many studies. However, the evidence for this is limited. METHODS: In a detailed study of influenza virus transmission within households in 2008-12, we recruited index cases with confirmed influenza infection from outpatient clinics, and followed up their household contacts for 7-10 days to identify secondary infections. We used individual-based hazard models to characterize the relationship between individual viral shedding and individual infectivity. RESULTS: We analyzed 386 households with 1147 household contacts. Index cases were separated into 3 groups according to their estimated level of viral shedding at symptom onset. We did not find a statistically significant association of virus shedding with transmission. Index cases in medium and higher viral shedding groups were estimated to have 21\% (95\% CI: -29\%, 113\%) and 44\% (CI: -16\%, 167\%) higher infectivity, compared with those in the lower viral shedding group. CONCLUSIONS: Individual viral load measured by RT-PCR in the nose and throat was at most weakly correlated with individual infectivity in households. Other correlates of infectivity should be examined in future studies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few studies report the effectiveness of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) in preventing hospitalisation for influenza-confirmed respiratory infections. Using a prospective surveillance platform, this study reports the first such estimate from a well-defined ethnically diverse population in New Zealand (NZ). METHODS: A case test-negative design was used to estimate propensity adjusted vaccine effectiveness. Patients with a severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), defined as a patient of any age requiring hospitalisation with a history of a fever or a measured temperature ≥38°C and cough and onset within the past 7 days, admitted to public hospitals in South and Central Auckland were eligible for inclusion in the study. Cases were SARI patients who tested positive for influenza, while non-cases (controls) were SARI patients who tested negative. Results were adjusted for the propensity to be vaccinated and the timing of the influenza season. RESULTS: The propensity and season adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated as 39\% (95\% CI 16;56). The VE point estimate against influenza A (H1N1) was lower than for influenza B or influenza A (H3N2) but confidence intervals were wide and overlapping. Estimated VE was 59\% (95\% CI 26;77) in patients aged 45-64 years but only 8\% (-78;53) in those aged 65 years and above. CONCLUSION: Prospective surveillance for SARI has been successfully established in NZ. This study for the first year, the 2012 influenza season, has shown low to moderate protection by TIV against influenza positive hospitalisation.},

This is despite vaccines being in use for over 70\textbackslash,years and currently being administered to around 500 million people each year. Improvements in vaccine design are needed to increase the strength, breadth, and duration of immunity against diverse strains that circulate during regular epidemics, occasional pandemics, and from animal reservoirs. Universal vaccine strategies that target more conserved regions of the virus, such as the hemagglutinin (HA)-stalk, or recruit other cellular responses, such as T cells and NK cells, have the potential to provide broader immunity. Many pre-pandemic vaccines in clinical development do not utilize new vaccine platforms but use "tried and true" recombinant HA protein or inactivated virus strategies despite substantial leaps in fundamental research on universal vaccines. Significant hurdles exist for universal vaccine development from bench to bedside, so that promising preclinical data is not yet translating to human clinical trials. Few studies have assessed immune correlates derived from asymptomatic influenza virus infections, due to the scale of a study required to identity these cases. The realization and implementation of a universal influenza vaccine requires identification and standardization of set points of protective immune correlates, and consideration of dosage schedule to maximize vaccine uptake.},

  abstract = {The prospect of universal influenza vaccines is generating much interest and research at the intersection of immunology, epidemiology, and viral evolution. While the current focus is on developing a vaccine that elicits a broadly cross-reactive immune response in clinical trials, there are important downstream questions about global deployment of a universal influenza vaccine that should be explored to minimize unintended consequences and maximize benefits. Here, we review and synthesize the questions most relevant to predicting the population benefits of universal influenza vaccines and discuss how existing information could be mined to begin to address these questions. We review three research topics where computational modeling could bring valuable evidence: immune imprinting, viral evolution, and transmission. We address the positive and negative consequences of imprinting, in which early childhood exposure to influenza shapes and limits immune responses to future infections via memory of conserved influenza antigens. However, the mechanisms at play, their effectiveness, breadth of protection, and the ability to "reprogram" already imprinted individuals, remains heavily debated. We describe instances of rapid influenza evolution that illustrate the plasticity of the influenza virus in the face of drug pressure and discuss how novel vaccines could introduce new selective pressures on the evolution of the virus. We examine the possible unintended consequences of broadly protective (but infection-permissive) vaccines on the dynamics of epidemic and pandemic influenza, compared to conventional vaccines that have been shown to provide herd immunity benefits. In conclusion, computational modeling offers a valuable tool to anticipate the benefits of ambitious universal influenza vaccine programs, while balancing the risks from endemic influenza strains and unpredictable pandemic viruses. Moving forward, it will be important to mine the vast amount of data generated in clinical studies of universal influenza vaccines to ensure that the benefits and consequences of these vaccine programs have been carefully modeled and explored.},

  abstract = {The search for a test that can predict vaccine efficacy is an important part of any vaccine development program. Although regulators hesitate to acknowledge any test as a true ‘correlate of protection’, there are many precedents for defining ‘surrogate’ assays. Surrogates can be powerful tools for vaccine optimization, licensure, comparisons between products and development of improved products. When such tests achieve ‘reference’ status however, they can inadvertently become barriers to new technologies that do not work the same way as existing vaccines. This is particularly true when these tests are based upon circularly-defined ‘reference’ or, even worse, proprietary reagents. The situation with inactivated influenza vaccines is a good example of this phenomenon. The most frequently used tests to define vaccine-induced immunity are all serologic assays: hemagglutination inhibition (HI), single radial hemolysis (SRH) and microneutralization (MN). The first two, and particularly the HI assay, have achieved reference status and criteria have been established in many jurisdictions for their use in licensing new vaccines and to compare the performance of different vaccines. However, all of these assays are based on biological reagents that are notoriously difficult to standardize and can vary substantially by geography, by chance (i.e. developing reagents in eggs that may not antigenitically match wild-type viruses) and by intention (ie: choosing reagents that yield the most favorable results). This review describes attempts to standardize these assays to improve their performance as surrogates, the dangers of over-reliance on ‘reference’ serologic assays, the ways that manufacturers can exploit the existing regulatory framework to make their products ‘look good’ and the implications of this long-established system for the introduction of novel influenza vaccines.},

  abstract = {Influenza virus vaccines are unique among currently licensed viral vaccines. The vaccines designed to protect against seasonal influenza illness must be updated periodically in an effort to match the vaccine strain with currently circulating viruses, and the vaccine manufacturing timeline includes multiple, overlapping processes with a very limited amount of flexibility. In the United States (U.S.), over 150 million doses of seasonal trivalent and quadrivalent vaccine are produced annually, a mammoth effort, particularly in the context of a vaccine with components that usually change on a yearly basis. In addition, emergence of an influenza virus containing an HA subtype that has not recently circulated in humans is an ever present possibility. Recently, pandemic influenza vaccines have been licensed, and the pathways for licensure of pandemic vaccines and subsequent strain updating have been defined. Thus, there are formidable challenges for the regulation of currently licensed influenza vaccines, as well as for the regulation of influenza vaccines under development. This review describes the process of licensing influenza vaccines in the U.S., the process and steps involved in the annual updating of seasonal influenza vaccines, and some recent experiences and regulatory challenges faced in development and evaluation of novel influenza vaccines.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Older adults are prioritized for influenza vaccination but also have lowered antibody responses to the vaccine. Higher-doses of influenza antigen may increase immune response and thus be more effective. Our objectives were to compare the efficacy and safety of the high-dose influenza vaccine to the standard-dose influenza vaccine in the elderly (age {$>$} 65). Methods: Data sources: Randomized trials (RCTs) from Medline (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), Cochrane Library (Wiley), ClinicalTrials.gov, reference lists of relevant articles, and gray literature. Study selection: Two reviewers independently identified RCTs comparing high-dose influenza vaccine (60 lg of hemagglutinin per strain) to standard-dose influenza vaccine (15 lg of hemagglutinin per strain) in adults over the age of 65 years. Data extraction: Two reviewers independently extracted trial-level data including population characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and funding sources. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Results: We included seven eligible trials; all were categorized as having a low (n = 3) or unclear (n = 4) risk of bias. Patients receiving the high-dose vaccine had significantly less risk of developing laboratoryconfirmed influenza infections (Relative Risk 0.76, 95\%CI 0.65 to 0.90; I2 0\%, 2 trials, 41,141 patients). Post-vaccination geometric mean titres and seroprotection rates were also higher in high-dose vaccine recipients. There were no protocol-defined serious adverse events in the included trials in either group. Conclusions: In elderly adults, the high-dose influenza vaccine was well-tolerated, more immunogenic, and more efficacious in preventing influenza infections than the standard-dose vaccine. Further pragmatic trials are needed to determine if the higher efficacy translates into higher vaccine effectiveness in adults over the age of 65.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The immunologic factors underlying severe influenza are poorly understood. To address this, we compared the immune responses of influenza-confirmed hospitalized individuals with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) to those of nonhospitalized individuals with influenza-like illness (ILI). METHODS: Peripheral blood lymphocytes were collected from 27 patients with ILI and 27 with SARI, at time of enrollment and then 2 weeks later. Innate and adaptive cellular immune responses were assessed by flow cytometry, and serum cytokine levels were assessed by a bead-based assay. RESULTS: During the acute phase, SARI was associated with significantly reduced numbers of circulating myeloid dendritic cells, CD192+ monocytes, and influenza virus-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells as compared to ILI. By the convalescent phase, however, most SARI cases displayed continued immune activation characterized by increased numbers of CD16+ monocytes and proliferating, and influenza virus-specific, CD8+ T cells as compared to ILI cases. SARI was also associated with reduced amounts of cytokines that regulate T-cell responses (ie, interleukin 4, interleukin 13, interleukin 12, interleukin 10, and tumor necrosis factor β) and hematopoiesis (interleukin 3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) but increased amounts of a proinflammatory cytokine (tumor necrosis factor α), chemotactic cytokines (MDC, MCP-1, GRO, and fractalkine), and growth-promoting cytokines (PDGFBB/AA, VEGF, and EGF) as compared to ILI. CONCLUSIONS: Severe influenza cases showed a delay in the peripheral immune activation that likely led prolonged inflammation, compared with mild influenza cases.},

Seroconversion to HA was more frequent in those\,{$<$}20\,years old (yo) for influenza A (serosurvey, P\,=\,0.01; immunology, P\,=\,0.02) but not influenza B virus infection. Seroconversion to NA was not influenced by age or virus type. Adults\,≥20 yo infected with influenza A viruses were more likely to show NA-only seroconversion compared to children (56\% versus 14\% [5 to 19 yo] and 0\% [0 to 4 yo], respectively). Conversely, children infected with influenza B viruses were more likely than adults to show NA-only seroconversion (88\% [0 to 4 yo] and 75\% [5 to 19 yo] versus 40\% [≥20 yo]). These data indicate a potential role for immunological memory in the dynamics of HA and NA antibody responses. A better mechanistic understanding of this phenomenon will be critical for any future vaccines aimed at eliciting NA immunity.IMPORTANCE Data on the immunologic responses to neuraminidase (NA) is lacking compared to what is available on hemagglutinin (HA) responses, despite growing evidence that NA immunity can be protective and broadly cross-reactive. Understanding these NA responses during natural infection is key to exploiting these properties for improving influenza vaccines. Using two community-acquired influenza cohorts, we showed that the induction of both HA and NA antibodies after infection is influenced by age and subtypes. Such response dynamics suggest the influence of immunological memory, and understanding how this process is regulated will be critical to any vaccine effort targeting NA immunity.},

  abstract = {The failure to mount an antibody response following viral infection or seroconversion failure is a largely underappreciated and poorly understood phenomenon. Here, we identified immunologic markers associated with robust antibody responses after influenza virus infection in two independent human cohorts, SHIVERS and FLU09, based in Auckland, New Zealand and Memphis, Tennessee, USA, respectively. In the SHIVERS cohort, seroconversion significantly associates with (1) hospitalization, (2) greater numbers of proliferating, activated CD4+ T~cells, but not CD8+ T~cells, in the periphery during the acute phase of illness, and (3) fewer inflammatory monocytes (CD14hiCD16+) by convalescence. In the FLU09 cohort, fewer CD14hiCD16+ monocytes during early illness in the nasal mucosa were also associated with the generation of influenza-specific mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG antibodies. Our study demonstrates that seroconversion failure after infection is a definable immunological phenomenon, associated with quantifiable cellular markers that can be used to improve diagnostics, vaccine efficacy, and epidemiologic efforts.},

  abstract = {Seroprevalence survey is the most practical method for accurately estimating infection attack rate (IAR) in an epidemic such as influenza. These studies typically entail selecting an arbitrary titer threshold for seropositivity (e.g. microneutralization [MN] 1:40) and assuming the probability of seropositivity given infection (infection-seropositivity probability, ISP) is 100\% or similar to that among clinical cases. We hypothesize that such conventions are not necessarily robust because different thresholds may result in different IAR estimates and serologic responses of clinical cases may not be representative. To illustrate our hypothesis, we used an age-structured transmission model to fully characterize the transmission dynamics and seroprevalence rises of 2009 influenza pandemic A/H1N1 (pdmH1N1) during its first wave in Hong Kong. We estimated that while 99\% of pdmH1N1 infections became MN1:20 seropositive, only 72\%, 62\%, 58\% and 34\% of infections among age 3-12, 13-19, 20-29, 30-59 became MN1:40 seropositive, which was much lower than the 90\%-100\% observed among clinical cases. The fitted model was consistent with prevailing consensus on pdmH1N1 transmission characteristics (e.g. initial reproductive number of 1.28 and mean generation time of 2.4 days which were within the consensus range), hence our ISP estimates were consistent with the transmission dynamics and temporal buildup of population-level immunity. IAR estimates in influenza seroprevalence studies are sensitive to seropositivity thresholds and ISP adjustments which in current practice are mostly chosen based on conventions instead of systematic criteria. Our results thus highlighted the need for reexamining conventional practice to develop standards for analyzing influenza serologic data (e.g. real-time assessment of bias in ISP adjustments by evaluating the consistency of IAR across multiple thresholds and with mixture models), especially in the context of pandemics when robustness and comparability of IAR estimates are most needed for informing situational awareness and risk assessment. The same principles are broadly applicable for seroprevalence studies of other infectious disease outbreaks.},

The models predicted the categorical response for {$>$}\,75\% of the cases in all subsets with one exception. Prior vaccination, baseline titer level, and age were the major determinants of seroconversion, all of which had negative effects. Further, we identified a gender effect in older participants and an effect of vaccination month. BMI had a surprisingly small effect, likely due to its correlation with age. Comorbidities, vaccine dose, and race had negligible effects. Our models can generate a new seroconversion score that is corrected for the impact of these factors which can facilitate future biomarker identification., Computational modeling quantifies the effects of confounding factors on the serological response to flu vaccination in large human cohorts and reveals a differential impact of prior vaccination status, recipient age, and the month of vaccination.},

Antibody profiles can be generated by characterizing immune responses to multiple antigenically variant strains, but how these profiles vary across individuals and determine future responses is unclear. We used hemagglutination inhibition titers from 21 H3N2 strains to construct 777 paired antibody profiles from people aged 2 to 86, and developed novel metrics to capture features of these profiles. Total antibody titer per potential influenza exposure increases in early life, then decreases in middle age. Increased titers to one or more strains were seen in 97.8\% of participants during a roughly four-year interval, suggesting widespread influenza exposure. While titer changes were seen to all strains, recently circulating strains exhibited the greatest titer rise. Higher pre-existing, homologous titers at baseline reduced the risk of seroconversion to recent strains. After adjusting for homologous titer, we also found an increased frequency of seroconversion against recent strains among those with higher immunity to older previously exposed strains. Including immunity to previously exposures also improved the deviance explained by the models. Our results suggest that a comprehensive quantitative description of immunity encompassing past exposures could lead to improved correlates of risk of influenza infection.},

The aim of this review is to better understand the mechanism of anti-NA immunity, and also to evaluate the approaches on developing NA-based influenza vaccines or enhancing immune responses against NA for current influenza vaccines. AREAS COVERED: In this review, the structure of influenza neuraminidase, the contribution of anti-NA immunity to protection, as well as the efforts and challenges of targeting the immune responses to NA were discussed. We also listed some of the newly discovered anti-NA monoclonal antibodies and discussed their contribution in therapeutic as well as the antigen design of a broadly protective NA vaccine. EXPERT OPINION: Targeting the immune response to both HA and NA may be critical for achieving the optimal protection since there are different mechanisms of HA and NA elicited protective immunity. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target the conserved protective lateral face or catalytic sites are effective therapeutics. The epitope discovery using monoclonal antibodies may benefit NA-based vaccine elicited broadly reactive antibody responses. Therefore, the potential for a vaccine that elicits cross-reactive antibodies against neuraminidase is a high priority for next-generation influenza vaccines.},

Extending their research, we propose a Bayesian approach to estimating the causal vaccine effects on binary post-infection outcomes. The identifiability of the causal vaccine effect VEI is discussed under different assumptions on selection bias. The performance of the proposed Bayesian method is compared with the maximum likelihood method through simulation studies and two case studies — a clinical trial of a rotavirus vaccine candidate and a field study of pertussis vaccination. For both case studies, the Bayesian approach provided similar inference as the frequentist analysis. However, simulation studies with small sample sizes suggest that the Bayesian approach provides smaller bias and shorter confidence interval length. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
