  abstract = {Background The implementation of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 has successfully validated the safety and efficacy of the platform, while at the same time revealing the potential for their applications against other infectious diseases. Traditional seasonal influenza vaccines often induce strain specific antibody responses that offer limited protection against antigenically drifted viruses, leading to reduced vaccine efficacy. Modern advances in viral surveillance and sequencing have led to the development of in-silico methodologies for generating computationally optimized broadly reactive antigens (COBRAs) to improve seasonal influenza vaccines. Methods In this study, immunologically na√Øve mice were intramuscularly vaccinated with mRNA encoding H1 and H3 COBRA hemagglutinins (HA) or wild-type (WT) influenza HAs encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Results Mice vaccinated with H1 and H3 COBRA HA-encoding mRNA vaccines generated robust neutralizing serum antibody responses against more antigenically distinct contemporary and future drifted H1N1 and H3N2 influenza strains than those vaccinated with WT H1 and H3 HA-encoding mRNA vaccines. The H1 and H3 COBRA HA-encoding mRNA vaccines also prevented influenza illness, including severe disease in the mouse model against H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. Conclusions This study highlights the potential benefits of combining universal influenza antigen design technology with modern vaccine delivery platforms and exhibits how these vaccines can be advantageous over traditional WT vaccine antigens at eliciting superior protective antibody responses against a broader number of influenza virus isolates.},

  abstract = {Seasonal influenza causes substantial morbidity and mortality because of efficient human-to-human spread. Rarely, zoonotic strains of influenza virus spread to humans, where they have the potential to mediate new pandemics with high mortality. We studied systemic viral spread after intranasal infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1 [A/Viet Nam/1203/2004]) in ferrets with or without prior pandemic H1N1pdm09 (A/Mexico/4108/2009) or H3N2 (A/Victoria/361/2011) infection. After intranasal challenge with H5N1 influenza virus, naive ferrets rapidly succumbed to systemic infection. Animals challenged with H5N1 influenza virus greater than 3 months after recovering from an initial H1N1pdm09 infection survived H5N1 virus challenge and cleared virus from the respiratory tract 4 days after infection. However, a prolonged low-level infection of hematopoietic elements in the small bowel lamina propria, liver, and spleen was present for greater than 2 weeks postinfection, raising the potential for reassortment of influenza genes in a host infected with multiple strains of influenza. Animals previously infected with an H3N2 influenza virus succumbed to systemic disease and encephalitis after H5N1 virus challenge. These results indicate prior infection with different seasonal influenza strains leads to radically different protection from H5N1 challenge and fatal encephalitis., IMPORTANCE Seasonal influenza is efficiently transmitted from human to human, causing substantial morbidity and mortality. Rarely, zoonotic strains of influenza virus spread to humans, where they have the potential to mediate new pandemics with high mortality. Infection of naive ferrets with H5N1 avian influenza virus causes a rapid and lethal systemic disease. We studied systemic H5N1 viral spread after infection of ferrets with or without prior exposure to either of two seasonal influenza virus strains, H1N1 and H3N2. Ferrets previously infected with H1N1 survive H5N1 challenge while those previously infected with H3N2 die of encephalitis. However ferrets protected from lethal H5N1 infection develop persistent low-level infection of the small intestine, liver, or spleen, providing a nidus for future viral strain recombination. The mechanism by which prior infection with specific strains of seasonal influenza virus protect from lethal H5N1 challenge needs to be elucidated in order to design effective immunization and treatments.},

Despite moving to a quadrivalent vaccine to include strains from both the B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages, vaccine effectiveness rates continue to be variable and low in many past seasons. To develop more effective influenza B virus vaccines, three novel IBV hemagglutinin (HA) vaccines were designed using a computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) methodology. These IBV HA proteins were expressed on the surface of a virus-like particle (VLP) and used to vaccinate ferrets that were pre-immune to historical B/Victoria or B/Yamagata lineage viruses. Ferrets vaccinated with B-COBRA HA vaccines had neutralizing antibodies with high titer HAI titer against all influenza B viruses regardless of pre-immunization history. Conversely, VLPs expressing wild-type IBV HA antigens preferentially boosted titers against viruses from the same lineage and there was little-to-no seroprotective antibodies detected in ferrets with mismatched IBV pre-immune infections. Overall, a single IBV HA developed using the COBRA methodology elicited protective broadly-reactive antibodies against current and future drifted IBVs from both lineages.},

  abstract = {Most preclinical animal studies test influenza vaccines in immunologically naive animal models, even though the results of vaccination may not accurately reflect the effectiveness of vaccine candidates in humans that have preexisting immunity to influenza. In this study, novel, broadly reactive influenza vaccine candidates were assessed in preimmune ferrets. These animals were infected with different H1N1 isolates before being vaccinated or infected with another influenza virus. Previously, our group has described the design and characterization of computationally optimized broadly reactive hemagglutinin (HA) antigens (COBRA) for H1N1 isolates. Vaccinating ferrets with virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines expressing COBRA HA proteins elicited antibodies with hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) activity against more H1N1 viruses in the panel than VLP vaccines expressing wild-type HA proteins. Specifically, ferrets infected with the 1986 virus and vaccinated with a single dose of the COBRA HA VLP vaccines elicited antibodies with HAI activity against 11 to 14 of the 15 H1N1 viruses isolated between 1934 and 2013. A subset of ferrets was infected with influenza viruses expressing the COBRA HA antigens. These COBRA preimmune ferrets had superior breadth of HAI activity after vaccination with COBRA HA VLP vaccines than COBRA preimmune ferrets vaccinated with VLP vaccines expressing wild-type HA proteins. Overall, priming naive ferrets with COBRA HA based viruses or using COBRA HA based vaccines to boost preexisting antibodies induced by wild-type H1N1 viruses, COBRA HA antigens elicited sera with the broadest HAI reactivity against multiple antigenic H1N1 viral variants. This is the first report demonstrating the effectiveness of a broadly reactive or universal influenza vaccine in a preimmune ferret model., IMPORTANCE Currently, many groups are testing influenza vaccine candidates to meet the challenge of developing a vaccine that elicits broadly reactive and long-lasting protective immune responses. The goal of these vaccines is to stimulate immune responses that react against most, if not all, circulating influenza strains, over a long period of time in all populations of people. Commonly, these experimental vaccines are tested in naive animal models that do not have anti-influenza immune responses; however, humans have preexisting immunity to influenza viral antigens, particularly antibodies to the HA and NA glycoproteins. Therefore, this study investigated how preexisting antibodies to historical influenza viruses influenced HAI-specific antibodies and protective efficacy using a broadly protective vaccine candidate.},

  abstract = {Direct transmission of avian influenza viruses to mammals has become an increasingly investigated topic during the past decade; however, isolates that have been primarily investigated are typically ones originating from human or poultry outbreaks. Currently there is minimal comparative information on the behavior of the innumerable viruses that exist in the natural wild bird host. We have previously demonstrated the capacity of numerous North American avian influenza viruses isolated from wild birds to infect and induce lesions in the respiratory tract of mice. In this study, two isolates from shorebirds that were previously examined in mice (H1N9 and H6N1 subtypes) are further examined through experimental inoculations in the ferret with analysis of viral shedding, histopathology, and antigen localization via immunohistochemistry to elucidate pathogenicity and transmission of these viruses. Using sequence analysis and glycan binding analysis, we show that these avian viruses have the typical avian influenza binding pattern, with affinity for cell glycoproteins/glycolipids having terminal sialic acid (SA) residues with Œ± 2,3 linkage [Neu5Ac(Œ±2,3)Gal]. Despite the lack of Œ±2,6 linked SA binding, these AIVs productively infected both the upper and lower respiratory tract of ferrets, resulting in nasal viral shedding and pulmonary lesions with minimal morbidity. Moreover, we show that one of the viruses is able to transmit to ferrets via direct contact, despite its binding affinity for Œ± 2,3 linked SA residues. These results demonstrate that avian influenza viruses, which are endemic in aquatic birds, can potentially infect humans and other mammals without adaptation. Finally this work highlights the need for additional study of the wild bird subset of influenza viruses in regard to surveillance, transmission, and potential for reassortment, as they have zoonotic potential.},

Most influenza vaccine research studies use immunologically na√Øve animal models to assess vaccine effectiveness. However, most people have an extensive influenza immune history, with memory cells produced by viruses or vaccines representing multiple influenza viruses. In this study, we explored the effect influenza seasonal virus-induced immunity has on pre-pandemic influenza virus vaccination. The mice that were pre-immune to historical H1N1 and H3N2 seasonal influenza viruses were vaccinated with adjuvanted pre-pandemic (H2, H5, and H7) HA-based computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) vaccines, and were fully protected from lethal challenge, whereas the mock-vaccinated mice, with or without pre-immunity, were not protected from morbidity or mortality. Detectable antibody titers were present in the pre-immune mice vaccinated with a single dose of vaccine, but not in the immunologically na√Øve mice. The mice vaccinated twice with the trivalent COBRA HA vaccine had similar antibody titers regardless of their pre-immune status. Overall, seasonal pre-immunity did not interfere with the immune responses elicited by pre-pandemic COBRA HA vaccines or the protection against pre-pandemic viruses.},

  abstract = {Influenza virus infection causes a range of outcomes from mild illness to death. The molecular mechanisms leading to these differential host responses are currently unknown. Herein, we identify the induction of high mannose, a glycan epitope, as a key mediator of severe disease outcome. We propose a mechanism in which activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) upon influenza virus infection induces cell surface high mannose, which is then recognized by the innate immune lectin MBL2, activating the complement cascade and leading to subsequent inflammation. This work is the first to systematically study host glycomic changes in response to influenza virus infection, identifying high mannose as a key feature of differential host response., Influenza virus infections cause a wide variety of outcomes, from mild disease to 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and ‚àº290,000 to 645,000 deaths annually worldwide. The molecular mechanisms underlying these disparate outcomes are currently unknown. Glycosylation within the human host plays a critical role in influenza virus biology. However, the impact these modifications have on the severity of influenza disease has not been examined. Herein, we profile the glycomic host responses to influenza virus infection as a function of disease severity using a ferret model and our lectin microarray technology. We identify the glycan epitope high mannose as a marker of influenza virus-induced pathogenesis and severity of disease outcome. Induction of high mannose is dependent upon the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, a pathway previously shown to associate with lung damage and severity of influenza virus infection. Also, the mannan-binding lectin (MBL2), an innate immune lectin that negatively impacts influenza outcomes, recognizes influenza virus-infected cells in a high mannose-dependent manner. Together, our data argue that the high mannose motif is an infection-associated molecular pattern on host cells that may guide immune responses leading to the concomitant damage associated with severity.},

  abstract = {The specificity of H1N1 antibody responses can be shifted to epitopes near the HA receptor‚Äìbinding domain after sequential infections with viral strains that share homology in this region., Human antibody responses against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus are predominantly directed against conserved epitopes in the stalk and receptor-binding domain of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein. This is in stark contrast to pH1N1 antibody responses generated in ferrets, which are focused on the variable Sa antigenic site of HA. Here, we show that most humans born between 1983 and 1996 elicited pH1N1 antibody responses that are directed against an epitope near the HA receptor‚Äìbinding domain. Importantly, most individuals born before 1983 or after 1996 did not elicit pH1N1 antibodies to this HA epitope. The HAs of most seasonal H1N1 (sH1N1) viruses that circulated between 1983 and 1996 possess a critical K133 amino acid in this HA epitope, whereas this amino acid is either mutated or deleted in most sH1N1 viruses circulating before 1983 or after 1996. We sequentially infected ferrets with a 1991 sH1N1 virus and then a pH1N1 virus. Sera isolated from these animals were directed against the HA epitope involving amino acid K133. These data suggest that the specificity of pH1N1 antibody responses can be shifted to epitopes near the HA receptor‚Äìbinding domain after sequential infections with sH1N1 and pH1N1 viruses that share homology in this region.},

Furthermore, transfer of anti-H7 serum did not protect mice against H7N9 challenge. PIV5-H7 generated high HAI titers in guinea pigs, however it did not protect against H7N9 infection or transmission. Intriguingly, immunization of guinea pigs with PIV5-H7 and PIV5 expressing NP of influenza A virus H5N1 (PIV5-NP) conferred protection against H7N9 infection and transmission.

  abstract = {Influenza outbreaks are associated with substantial morbidity, mortality and economic burden. Next generation antivirals are needed to treat seasonal infections and prepare against zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses with pandemic potential. Having previously identified oral efficacy of the nucleoside analog 4‚Äô-Fluorouridine (4‚Äô-FlU, EIDD-2749) against SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), we explored activity of the compound against seasonal and highly pathogenic influenza (HPAI) viruses in cell culture, human airway epithelium (HAE) models, and/or two animal models, ferrets and mice, that assess IAV transmission and lethal viral pneumonia, respectively. 4‚Äô-FlU inhibited a panel of relevant influenza A and B viruses with nanomolar to sub-micromolar potency in HAE cells. In vitro polymerase assays revealed immediate chain termination of IAV polymerase after 4‚Äô-FlU incorporation, in contrast to delayed chain termination of SARS-CoV-2 and RSV polymerase. Once-daily oral treatment of ferrets with 2 mg/kg 4‚Äô-FlU initiated 12 hours after infection rapidly stopped virus shedding and prevented transmission to untreated sentinels. Treatment of mice infected with a lethal inoculum of pandemic A/CA/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 (pdmCa09) with 4‚Äô-FlU alleviated pneumonia. Three doses mediated complete survival when treatment was initiated up to 60 hours after infection, indicating a broad time window for effective intervention. Therapeutic oral 4‚Äô-FlU ensured survival of animals infected with HPAI A/VN/12/2003 (H5N1) and of immunocompromised mice infected with pdmCa09. Recoverees were protected against homologous reinfection. This study defines the mechanistic foundation for high sensitivity of influenza viruses to 4‚Äô-FlU and supports 4‚Äô-FlU as developmental candidate for the treatment of seasonal and pandemic influenza., Next-generation antiviral therapeutics are needed to better mitigate seasonal influenza and prepare against zoonotic virus spillover from animal reservoirs. At greatest risk are the immunocompromised and patients infected with highly pathogenic influenza viruses. In this study, we have demonstrated efficacy of a broad-spectrum nucleoside analog, 4‚Äô-fluorouridine, against a representative panel of influenza viruses in cell culture, human airway epithelium (HAE) cells, and two animal models, ferrets and mice. Acting as an immediate chain terminator of the influenza virus polymerase, once-daily oral treatment protected against lethal infection with seasonal and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, prevented viral transmission to untreated sentinels, and mitigated lethal infection of immunocompromised hosts. These results support the developmental potential of 4‚Äô-fluorouridine for treatment of vulnerable patient groups and mitigation of pandemic influenza, providing a path towards a much-needed additional therapeutic option for improved disease management.},

Given the potential for the emerging H7N9 influenza virus to cause severe respiratory infections and the lack of exposure to H7 and N9 influenza viruses in the human population, we aimed to quantify the H7N9 cross-reactive memory T cell reservoir in humans and mice previously exposed to common circulating influenza viruses. We identified significant cross-reactive T cell populations in humans and mice; we also found that cross-reactive memory T cells afforded heterosubtypic protection by reducing morbidity and mortality upon lethal H7N9 challenge. In context with our observation that PR8-primed mice have limited humoral cross-reactivity with H7N9, our data suggest protection from H7N9 challenge is indeed mediated by cross-reactive T cell populations established upon previous priming with another influenza virus. Thus, pre-existing cross-reactive memory T cells may limit disease severity in the event of an H7N9 influenza virus pandemic.},

  abstract = {Seasonal human influenza virus continues to cause morbidity and mortality annually, and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses along with other emerging influenza viruses continue to pose pandemic threats. Vaccination is considered the most effective measure for controlling influenza; however, current strategies rely on a precise vaccine match with currently circulating virus strains for efficacy, requiring constant surveillance and regular development of matched vaccines. Current vaccines focus on eliciting specific antibody responses against the hemagglutinin (HA) surface glycoprotein; however, the diversity of HAs across species and antigenic drift of circulating strains enable the evasion of virus-inhibiting antibody responses, resulting in vaccine failure. The neuraminidase (NA) surface glycoprotein, while diverse, has a conserved enzymatic site and presents an appealing target for priming broadly effective antibody responses. Here we show that vaccination with parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), a promising live viral vector expressing NA from avian (H5N1) or pandemic (H1N1) influenza virus, elicited NA-specific antibody and T cell responses, which conferred protection against homologous and heterologous influenza virus challenges. Vaccination with PIV5-N1 NA provided cross-protection against challenge with a heterosubtypic (H3N2) virus. Experiments using antibody transfer indicate that antibodies to NA have an important role in protection. These findings indicate that PIV5 expressing NA may be effective as a broadly protective vaccine against seasonal influenza and emerging pandemic threats., IMPORTANCE Seasonal influenza viruses cause considerable morbidity and mortality annually, while emerging viruses pose potential pandemic threats. Currently licensed influenza virus vaccines rely on the antigenic match of hemagglutinin (HA) for vaccine strain selection, and most vaccines rely on HA inhibition titers to determine efficacy, despite the growing awareness of the contribution of neuraminidase (NA) to influenza virus vaccine efficacy. Although NA is immunologically subdominant to HA, and clinical studies have shown variable NA responses to vaccination, in this study, we show that vaccination with a parainfluenza virus 5 recombinant vaccine candidate expressing NA (PIV5-NA) from a pandemic influenza (pdmH1N1) virus or highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) virus elicits robust, cross-reactive protection from influenza virus infection in two animal models. New vaccination strategies incorporating NA, including PIV5-NA, could improve seasonal influenza virus vaccine efficacy and provide protection against emerging influenza viruses.},

Developing IAV vaccine strategies able to elicit broad heterologous protection against antigenically diverse IAV strains is pivotal in effectively controlling the disease. The goal of this study was to examine the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of diverse H1N1 influenza vaccine strategies including monovalent, bivalent, and heterologous prime-boost vaccination regimens, against a mismatched H1N2 swine influenza virus. Five groups were homologous prime-boost vaccinated with either an oil-adjuvanted whole-inactivated virus (WIV) monovalent A/swine/Georgia/27480/2019 (GA19) H1N2 vaccine, a WIV monovalent A/sw/Minnesota/A02636116/2021 (MN21) H1N1 vaccine, a WIV monovalent A/California/07/2009 (CA09) H1N1, a WIV bivalent vaccine composed of CA09 and MN21, or adjuvant only (mock-vaccinated group). A sixth group was prime-vaccinated with CA09 WIV and boosted with MN21 WIV (heterologous prime-boost group). Four weeks post-boost pigs were intranasally and intratracheally challenged with A/swine/Georgia/27480/2019, an H1N2 swine IAV field isolate. Vaccine-induced protection was evaluated based on five critical parameters: (i) hemagglutination inhibiting (HAI) antibody responses, (ii) clinical scores, (iii) virus titers in nasal swabs and respiratory tissue homogenates, (iv) BALf cytology, and (v) pulmonary pathology. While all vaccination regimens induced seroprotective titers against homologous viruses, heterologous prime-boost vaccination failed to enhance HAI responses against the homologous vaccine strains compared to monovalent vaccine regimens and did not expand the scope of cross-reactive antibody responses against antigenically distinct swine and human IAVs. Mismatched vaccination regimens not only failed to confer clinical and virological protection post-challenge but also exacerbated disease and pathology. In particular, heterologous-boosted pigs showed prolonged clinical disease and increased pulmonary pathology compared to mock-vaccinated pigs. Our results demonstrated that H1-specific heterologous prime-boost vaccination, rather than enhancing cross-protection, worsened the clinical outcome and pathology after challenge with the antigenically distant A/swine/Georgia/27480/2019 strain.},

  abstract = {The influenza viruses cause seasonal respiratory illness that affect millions of people globally every year. Prophylactic vaccines are the recommended method to prevent the breakout of influenza epidemics. One of the current commercial influenza vaccines consists of inactivated viruses that are selected months prior to the start of a new influenza season. In many seasons, the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of these vaccines can be relatively low. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop an improved, more universal influenza vaccine (UIV) that can provide broad protection against various drifted strains in all age groups. To meet this need, the computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) methodology was developed to design a hemagglutinin (HA) molecule as a new influenza vaccine. In this study, COBRA HA-based inactivated influenza viruses (IIV) expressing the COBRA HA from H1 or H3 influenza viruses were developed and characterized for the elicitation of immediate and long-term protective immunity in both immunologically na√Øve or influenza pre-immune animal models. These results were compared to animals vaccinated with IIV vaccines expressing wild-type H1 or H3 HA proteins (WT-IIV). The COBRA-IIV elicited long-lasting broadly reactive antibodies that had hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) activity against drifted influenza variants.},

  abstract = {Influenza virus infections present a pervasive global health concern resulting in millions of hospitalizations and thousands of fatalities annually. To address the influenza antigenic variation, the computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) methodology was used to design influenza hemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA) for universal influenza vaccine candidates. In this study, whole inactivated virus (WIV) or split inactivated virus (SIV) vaccine formulations expressing either the H1 COBRA HA or H3 COBRA HA were formulated with or without an adjuvant and tested in ferrets with pre-existing anti-influenza immunity. A single dose of the COBRA-WIV vaccine elicited a robust and broadly reactive antibody response against H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses. In contrast, the COBRA-SIV elicited antibodies that recognized fewer viruses, but with R-DOATP, its specificity was expanded. Vaccinated ferrets were protected against morbidity and mortality following challenge with A/California/07/2009 at 14 weeks post-vaccination with reduced viral shedding post-infection compared to the na√Øve ferrets. However, the COBRA-IIVs did not block the viral transmission to na√Øve ferrets. The contact infection induced less severe disease and delayed viral shedding than direct infection. Overall, the COBRA HA WIV or the COBRA HA SIV plus R-DOTAP elicited broadly reactive antibodies with long-term protection against viral challenge and reduced viral transmission following a single dose of vaccine in ferrets pre-immune to historical H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses. IMPORTANCE The goal of the next-generation influenza vaccine is to provide broadly reactive protection against various drifted influenza strains. With the previous studies evaluating the COBRA HA-based vaccines, the breadth of antibody activities was confirmed following two or three vaccinations. However, for the commercial influenza vaccine, only one shot is required. In this study, only one shot was administrated to the pre-immune ferrets and the COBRA-WIV efficiently elicited broadly reactive antibodies and long-lasting protection against the pdm09 strain. Moreover, this study showed that different infection methods can lead to different disease severity, which emphasizes the significance of the model selection. The infection was conducted 14 weeks post-vaccination to evaluate the long-term protection elicited by only one vaccination. This is the first longevity study describing the immune responses elicited by COBRA-IIVs in ferrets and provides promising results for the potential clinical utilization.},

Ferrets were vaccinated twice with the oligomeric or monomeric rHA1 or with SU-H5N1 (Sanofi Pasteur) emulsified with Titermax adjuvant and were challenged with wild-type homologous (A/Vietnam/1203/04; clade 1) or heterologous (A/Whooperswan/Mongolia/244/2005; clade 2.2) virus. Only the oligomeric rHA1 (not the monomeric rHA1) immunogen and the SU-H5N1 vaccine provided protection against the lethality and morbidity of homologous and heterologous highly pathogenic H5N1. Oligomeric rHA1 generated more cross-neutralizing antibodies and higher levels of serum antibody binding to HA1, with stronger avidity and a better IgG/IgM ratio, than monomeric HA1 and SU-H5N1 vaccines, as determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Importantly, viral loads after heterologous H5N1 challenge were more efficiently controlled in ferrets vaccinated with the oligomeric rHA1 immunogen than in SU-H5N1-vaccinated ferrets. The reduction of viral loads in the nasal washes correlated strongly with higher-avidity antibodies to oligomeric rHA1 derived from H5N1 clade 1 and clade 2.2 viruses, as measured by SPR. This is the first study to show the role of antibody avidity for the HA1 globular head domain in reduction of viral loads in the upper respiratory tract, which could significantly reduce viral transmission.},

  abstract = {Each influenza season, a set of wild-type viruses, representing one H1N1, one H3N2, and one to two influenza B isolates, are selected for inclusion in the annual seasonal influenza vaccine. In order to develop broadly reactive subtype-specific influenza vaccines, a methodology called computationally optimized broadly reactive antigens (COBRA) was used to design novel hemagglutinin (HA) vaccine immunogens. COBRA technology was effectively used to design HA immunogens that elicited antibodies that neutralized H5N1 and H1N1 isolates. In this report, the development and characterization of 17 prototype H3N2 COBRA HA proteins were screened in mice and ferrets for the elicitation of antibodies with HA inhibition (HAI) activity against human seasonal H3N2 viruses that were isolated over the last 48 years. The most effective COBRA HA vaccine regimens elicited antibodies with broader HAI activity against a panel of H3N2 viruses than wild-type H3 HA vaccines. The top leading COBRA HA candidates were tested against cocirculating variants. These variants were not efficiently detected by antibodies elicited by the wild-type HA from viruses selected as the vaccine candidates. The T-11 COBRA HA vaccine elicited antibodies with HAI and neutralization activity against all cocirculating variants from 2004 to 2007. This is the first report demonstrating broader breadth of vaccine-induced antibodies against cocirculating H3N2 strains compared to the wild-type HA antigens that were represented in commercial influenza vaccines., IMPORTANCE There is a need for an improved influenza vaccine that elicits immune responses that recognize a broader number of influenza virus strains to prevent infection and transmission. Using the COBRA approach, a set of vaccines against influenza viruses in the H3N2 subtype was tested for the ability to elicit antibodies that neutralize virus infection against not only historical vaccine strains of H3N2 but also a set of cocirculating variants that circulated between 2004 and 2007. Three of the H3N2 COBRA vaccines recognized all of the cocirculating strains during this era, but the chosen wild-type vaccine strains were not able to elicit antibodies with HAI activity against these cocirculating strains. Therefore, the COBRA vaccines have the ability to elicit protective antibodies against not only the dominant vaccine strains but also minor circulating strains that can evolve into the dominant vaccine strains in the future.},

  abstract = {Influenza neuraminidase (NA) is a promising target for a broadly protective vaccine. In this study, the Computationally Optimized Broadly Reactive Antigen (COBRA) methodology was used to develop N2 NA vaccine candidates. The unique wild type (WT) N2 sequences of human and swine influenza strains isolated between 1957 and 2019 were used to design the COBRA N2-A NA vaccine, while the unique WT N2 sequences of human influenza strains isolated between 2000 and 2019 were used to design the COBRA N2-B NA vaccine. Sera collected from COBRA N2 NA vaccinated mice showed more broadly reactive antibody responses against a broad panel of H√óN2 influenza virus strains than sera collected from mice vaccinated with WT N2 NA vaccines. Antibodies elicited by COBRA or WT N2 NA antigens cross react with recent human H3N2 influenza viruses from different clades, while the antibodies elicited by A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 hemagglutinin (HA) reacted with viruses from the same clade. Furthermore, mice vaccinated with COBRA N2-B NA vaccine had lower viral lung titers compared to mock vaccinated mice when challenged with human H3N2 influenza viruses. Thus, the COBRA N2 NA vaccines elicit broadly protective murine anti-NA antibodies against multiple strains across subtypes and the viral loads were significantly decreased in the lungs of the mice in the COBRA N2 NA vaccine groups, compared to the mice in the mock vaccinated group, indicating that the COBRA-based N2 subtype NA vaccines have a potential to be a component in a universal influenza vaccine.},
