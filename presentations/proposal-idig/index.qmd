## Influenza Vaccines 

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}

Strains are chosen/recommended each year based on [@cdc24a]:

- Which influenza viruses are making people sick prior to the upcoming flu season,
- The extent to which those viruses are spreading prior to the upcoming flu season,
- How well the previous season's vaccines may protect against those influenza viruses, and
- The ability of vaccine viruses to provide cross-protection against a range of related influenza viruses of the same type or subtype/lineage.

## Problem/Significance

![](cdc-ve.png)

::: aside
VE is variable and often low; @cdc24c
:::

## Problem/Significance

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=40%}

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}

- Why is VE so low? Many different theories (probably a combination):
  - Original antigenic sin/imprinting
  - Low immunogenicity 
  - Match/Mismatch between vaccine strain and circulating strain

## Specific Aims

1. Identify and model correlates of protection against influenza in animal models.

2. Evaluate benefit of high-dose influenza vaccination by estimating and comparing Fluzone vaccine efficacies in age- and dose-based groups.

3. Quantify the impact of antigenic distance between vaccine and circulating influenza strains on vaccine effectiveness.

# **Aim 1.** Identify and model correlates of protection against influenza in animal models.

## Correlates of Protection (CoPs)

-   Biomarker associated with protection against infection or disease 
-   Related terms: surrogate, mechanistic/nonmechanistic correlate, mediator of protection
-   Nomenclature often depends on the believed causality of the marker
-   Often used in vaccine design, development, and licensure

-   Hobson 1972(date?) 1:40 50%PT
:::

## Problem/Significance 

-   Lack of research in correlates of protection in animal models 
-   Vaccine studies in animals base endpoints on human 50%PT
-   Lack of evidence supporting that those 50%PTs are the same 
-   Identifying true 50%PTs/CoP relationships in e.g. mouse, ferret studies can streamline vaccine development 

## [Planned] Data Description

:::

::: {.notes}
-   We are still working on data requests with bench scientists at UGA (and potentially elsewhere) who perform animal studies that follow this basic timeline. 
-   Essentially, we will request data sets that have mice or ferrets who are pre-immune and/or vaccinated at the beginning of the study, with pre-challenge HAI titers, reasonable inoculations (AKA not 10x the lethal dose), and follow up with infection and disease outcomes.

## Immunogenicity Studies 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=50%}

![](DAGFinal.png){height=350}

:::

::: {.column}

-   Efficacy studies time and resource intensive 
-   Immunogenicity studies typically more sustainable and done more regularly/for longer periods
-   Still useful to bring results back to actual protection

## Problem/Significance 

-   High-dose (HD) vaccines have evidence of reducing influenza morbidity and mortality in older adults 
-   Because efficacy studies are so resource intensive, there has not been an extended view of how much the HD vaccine helps older adults in terms of actual protection
-   We can use immunogenicity studies to estimate vaccine efficacy and compare protection in different groups

## Antigenic Match and Mismatch

::: {.column width=30%}

-   Is the chosen vaccine strain "the same" as the strain(s) infecting people?

Tricco match/mismatch:

_Influenza A strains from infected trial participants were matched with the strain in the vaccine if they belonged to the same A subtype (that is, H1N1 or H3N2) and were antigenically similar in the HI assay (that is, if they showed sufficient crossreaction in a HI chessboard table using ferret antisera; for example, with a HI typing quotient <fourfold titer). Influenza A viral strains were considered mismatched by antigenic drift if they were antigenically distinct from influenza A strains contained in the vaccine as per HI typing (for example, HI titer quotient ≥fourfold) or the characterization did not belong to a similar influenza A subtype contained in the vaccine (for example, H1N1 strains circulating but only H3N2 strains contained in the vaccine for bivalent vaccines with one H subtype)._

Tenforde paper:

_Among B/Victoria viruses, 926 (98%) of 945 sequenced viruses belonged to clade V1A.3, which contains a 3-amino acid deletion (162–164) in the HA protein and differs antigenically from the vaccine component (V1A.1), which has a 2-amino acid deletion (162–163) in the HA protein._


Skowronski paper:

_To understand low VE despite reports of vaccine match, we conducted further epidemiologic and laboratory investigations in end-of-season analyses. With additional participants and contributing viruses, we estimated VE against circulating strains belonging to both influenza A subtypes and B lineages accompanied by their in-depth genotypic and phenotypic characterization in relation to vaccine components. Specifically, vaccine-virus relatedness was assessed genotypically by determining the amino acid (AA) sequence of established haemagglutinin (HA) antigenic sites and phenotypically through the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. For H3N2, virus characterization was in relation to the A/Victoria/361/2011 prototype strain recommended by the WHO [10], as well as the egg-adapted high growth reassortant strain as per that actually used by manufacturers in vaccine production (hereafter ‘‘IVR-165’’) [11]. We show that suboptimal VE for the H3N2 component during the 2012–13 season was related to mutations in the egg-adapted IVR-165 vaccine strain, rather than antigenic drift in circulating viruses._


Belongia paper: 

_A virus was considered antigenically different from the corresponding vaccine vaccine strain if there was a >= 4 fold difference between the homologous HAI titer of the vaccine strain._

## Previous Literature

## Problem/Significance 

-   Match/mismatch has been dichotomous and arbitrarily defined in many papers 
-   Some studies have used antigenic distance over one or two seasons, or one specific flu type/subtype 
-   Understanding of the impact of antigenic distance on vaccine effectiveness is still weak


## [Planned] Data Description {.smaller}


```{r}
readRDS(
  here::here("presentations/proposal-idig/tb1_shell.rds")) |> 
  flextable::autofit() 
```


-   Gather vaccine strain history from CDC and WHO recommendations 
-   Find circulating strains from MMWRs, papers, reports, etc. for specific times and areas
-   Calculate antigenic distance multiple ways, including p-epitope, temporal, and Grantham

## Analysis Plan

-   Meta-analysis of papers/reports on vaccine effectiveness (VE) over the past 2+ decades 
-   Bayesian mixed-effects modeling predicting VE based on anitgenic distance
-   Account for age group, region, "repeat vaccination effect" 

## Analysis Plan

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=40%}

- Primary modeling result: what is the association between VE and antigenic distance?
