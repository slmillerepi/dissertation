  * Comparing three different vaccines against conventional egg-based standard-dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) - Fluzone Quadrivalent 
    * Quadrivalent cell-culture-based influenza vaccine (ccIIV4) (randomized) - Flucelvax Quadrivalent
    * Recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) (randomized) - Flublok Quadrivalent 
    * High-dose egg-based trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV3) (nonrandomized, added in second season) - Fluzone High-Dose
  * Conducted among health care providers (HCP) at two sites (Baylor Scott & White Health (BSWH) and Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW)) in 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 seasons 
    * Season 1 - HCP participants enrolled in randomized, open-label influenza vaccine trial were re-consented and enrolled in season 2 
    * Season 2 - eligible 18-64 (at start of first season) HCP (at both sites) who had received SD-IIV4 in season 1 were offered enrollment in randomized arms to receive SD-IIV4, RIV4, or ccIIV4
      * At KPNW, HCP were also recruited to receive open- and off-label HD-IIV3 (not randomized)
      * Q: Was this everybody of any age? If so, what was the age breakdown?
        * A: Yes. Mean age of 46, SD of 10; similar to other groups (Table 1)
  * Randomization:
    * Study site-specific stratified block randomization with 18-44 and 45-65 age groups
    * 1:1:1 randomization, receiving ccIIV4, RIV4, or SD-IIV4
  * Serum collection at d0/enrollment/pre-vax and ~1 month (20-62 days acceptable range) post-vax
  * Coprimary outcomes:
    * Serologic HAI responses at ~1 month post-vax using the following measures:    
      * Seroconversion rate (SCR)
      * Geometric mean titers (GMTs)
      * Mean-fold rise (MFR)
      * GMT ratios comparing post-vax HAI titers by study arm vs reference group 
  * Data analysis:
    * Only included those who received SD-IIV4 in season 1
    * **ANOVA** to compare GMT ratios, GMTs, and mean fold GMT rise 
    * **Logistic regression** to compared rates of SCR and proportions of participatns with postvaccination HAI titers greater than 1:40, 1:80, and 1:160
    * Models adjusted for study site, log pre-vax HAI titer
      * Sex, chronic medical conditions, and immunosuppresive conditions also considered but not significant 
    * Bonferroni correction led to statistical significance definition at $P=0.007$ and 99.3% CIs
    * Sensitivity analysis - restricted comparisons to KPNW
  * 390 HCP
    * 103 RIV4
    * 106 ccIIV4
    * 109 SD-IIV4
    * 79 HD-IIV3
  * "After adjusting for study site and the log of prevaccination HI titers, there were no statistically significant differences in postvaccination SCR, GMT, or MFR against any of the vaccine reference viruses between HD-IIV3 and SD-IIV4 recipients"
    * _Interesting that similar age groups don't seem to have a larger boost with HD vs SD_
  * "Adjusted postvaccination SCR, GMT, and MFR were significantly higher among ccIIV4 recipients compared with SD-IIV4 recipients against the A/ H1N1pdm09 reference virus only."
  * "CRs, GMTs, and MFRs were significantly higher among RIV4 recipients compared with SD-IIV4 recipients against all vaccine reference viruses."
  * "...higher proportions of RIV4 recipients had titers greater than 1:80 and 1:160 against the A(H1N1) pdm09, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria reference viruses and >1:160 against A(H3N2) [compared to reference group]" 
  * "There were no differences in the proportions of ccIIV4 compared with SD-IIV4 recipients with titers greater than 1:40, 1:80, or 1:160 for any vaccine reference virus, with the exception of HI titers >1:80 against A/ (H1N1)pdm09."
  * "There were no differences in the proportions of HD-IIV3 and SD-IIV4 recipients with titers greater than 1:40, 1:80, or 1:160 for any vaccine reference virus."
  * Seems like higher response to RIV4 might be driven by recombinant HA antigen rather than higher antigen dose 
    * Higher egg-based antigen dose alonse is not enough to increase responses in highly vaccinated adults 18-65
