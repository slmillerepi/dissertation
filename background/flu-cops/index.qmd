# History and General Background Papers 

## "The role of serum haemagglutination-inhibiting antibody in protection against challenge infection with influenza A2 and B viruses" [@hobson72]

  *   1032 adults - serum HAI taken right before live virus challenge
  *   Participants came from two different trials, but in both case, challenges were administered 2-3 weeks _after_ completed vaccination (whatever vaccination they may have received)
  * Serum samples taken both before and (two weeks) after challenge, and nasal swabs for virus isolation were taken 48 hours after challenge 
  * **50% Protective Dose** (PD50) - the titer at which the infection rate is reduced to half the maximum observed rate 
    *   Influenza B: Approximately 1/18 (Infection rate was not much higher in those with no detectable titer than in those with lowest detectable titer - 1/6)
    * Influenza A: 1/18-1/36 (multiple A studies)
  * Discussion - specify that this cannot be used to identify a causal relationship, and that HI is often only part of a greater immune response
    * HI appears to have stronger relationship than NI, but may specifically be less relevant in flu B - not enough data to tell in this study

## Determinants of immunity to influenza infection in man [@potter79]

  * Review 
  * "Most results indicate that, following immunization with inactivated virus vaccines, HI antibody titres of approximately 1:30-1:40 represent the 50% protective level of antibody (Hobson et al. 1972; Potter et al. 1977a), and similar results have been obtains following live virus infection (McDonald et al. 1962; Andrews et al. 1966)."

# Models and Identified CoP Relationships

## "On the relationship between mean antibody level, seroprotection and clinical protection from influenza" [@nauta2009a]

  * Modeling/simulations - no real results 
  * More notes later 

## "Relationship between haemagglutinationinhibiting antibody titres and clinical protection against influenza: development and application of a bayesian random-effects model" [@coudeville10]

  * Used 15 papers from 1945-2006; 6 challenge studies, 5 clinical trials, and 4 cohort studies 
  * Models tried:
    * Simple model for one study, no censorship and no covariates 
    * A random-effects model with uncensored data with covariates
    * A random-effects model with interval-censored data with covariates
  * Used MCMC methods for parameter estimation 
  * Determined simplest model (using only HAI titer) was sufficient for predicting protection

Estimation of the risk that an individual develops influenza in the presence HI antibodies: 

$$ P(Y_j = 1 | T_j, \theta, \lambda) = \lambda(1 - \pi(T_j, \theta)) $$ 

Simple model for one study, no censorship, and no covariates: 

$$ \pi(T_j, \theta) = \frac{e^{\beta(\log(T_j) - \alpha)}}{1 + e^{\beta(\log(T_j) - \alpha)}} $$

$$ = 1 - \frac{1}{1 + e^{\beta(\log(T_j) - \alpha)}} $$ 

  * $\alpha$ is closely linked to the 50% protection titer and can be interpreted as a location parameter for the HI protection curve

## "Hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers as a correlate of protection for inactivated influenza vaccines in children" [@black11]

  * 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 seasons
  * 4707 influenza vaccine-naive children 6-72 months randomized 2:2:1 into:
    * MF-59 –adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (ATIV, Fluad)
    * Subunit TIV (TIV control, Influsplit, GSK, Rixensart, Belgium) 
    * Saline placebo 
  * Active surveillance for ILI with RT-PCR confirmation
  * Serum samples obtained for a subset of 777 children at:
    * enrollment, 
    * on day 29 when the second dose was administered, 
    * at **day 50** (approximately 3 weeks after dose 2), and 
    * at day 180 after receipt of 2 doses of vaccine or placebo
  * Linear **logistic regression** model fitted with vaccine group only included as predictor 
  * Second logistic regression model was fit, which controlled for log2 day 50 antibody titer and vaccine group to determine the effect of antibody titer on the occurrence of influenza 
  * Relationship between the occurrence of influenza and H3N2 antibody titer level was modeled using the logistic regression model advocated by **Dunning** that accommodates both antibody titers and factors independent of antibody titers
    * Probability that a subject develops influenza is the probability that the subject is susceptible multiplied by the probability that susceptible individuals develop disease. Susceptibility is characterized by the probability $\lambda$, and the probability that a subject with titer t is protected is represented by a 2-parameter logit function, with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ denoting the location and the scale parameters of interest, respectively
  * Estimated CoP at time of "challenge" (time the diagnostic viral swab was obtained) using day 50 titer, estimated half life of 111 days and assuming logarithmic decay
  * Protective titers (at fixed time 50 days):
    * 50%: 1:110
    * 70%: 1:215
    * 80%: 1:330
    * 90%: 1:629
    * Traditional 1:40 was associated with 22% protection 
  * Protective titers (at time of "challenge"):
    * 50%: 1:85 (95% CI 35.6, 137.9)
    * 90%: 1:302 (95% CI 176.9, 439.2)

  * Children aged 6-17 in Hong Kong given TIV or placebo and followed for 9-12 months (Kiddivax)
    * The TIV contained 15 μg of hemagglutinin for each of the A/Brisbane/59/2007(H1N1)–like, A/Brisbane/10/2007(H3N2)like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008–like (Victoria lineage) strains. 
  * Serum samples collected pre-vaccine, one month post-vaccine, at end of follow up/study
    * 25% of participants had additional samples taken midstudy
  * 465 TIV, 308 placebo
  * Examined waning rates in absence of infection using log-linear regression models based on all postvaccination, midstudy, and end-of-study antibody titer data (separate for TIV vs placebo, excluding all possible infections)
    * Allowed for different wanting rates in those 6-8 and 9-17 years old 
  * **Cox proportional hazards model** estimating correlation of HAI titer over time with protection against PCR-confirmed infection, assessing if association different for TIV vs placebo group and allowing for time-varying incidence in the community 
  * Protective titers (accounting for waning and time-varying community risk of infection):
    * 1:40 against A(H1N1)pdm09: 48% (95% CI 30, 62)
    * 1:40 against B(Victoria): 55% (95% CI 32, 70)

A more recent study found that vaccine efficacy was highest among infants 8 weeks of age or younger and gradually decreased with increasing age."
  * Maternal cord blood HAI assays, followed children for first 6 months
  * **Cox proportional hazards model** for time from birth to infection, $\log_2$ titer and risk of PCR-confirmed infection
    * Adjusted for variation over calendar time in risk of infection by type/subtype based on community surveillance data

    * 83% (95% CI 44-95%) reduction in risk of infection compared to titer <10
  * No association for H3N2, not enough H1N1 infections
  * Only 26 infections total

## "A method to estimate probability of disease and vaccine efficacy from clinical trial immunogenicity data" [@dudasova2021]

  * PoDBAY
  * Probability of disease vs probability of protection 
  * R package
  * Not a flu-specific paper, but does have a flu example 
  * Have discussed this at IDIG before 


$$ PoD = p_{max} \frac{(\frac{et50}{titer})^\lambda}{1 + (\frac{et50}{titer})^\lambda}, for \space titers > 0 $$

$$ PoD = pmax, for \space titers <= 0 $$

  * pmax = maximum PoD $\approx \lambda$?  

  * et50 = titer values corresponding to pmax/2 value, PoD(et50) = pmax/2 $\approx$ 50%PT

## "Hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers mediate influenza vaccine efficacy against symptomatic influenza A(H1N1), A(H3N2), and B/Victoria infections" [@lim24]

  * Causal mediation analyses 
  * Children aged 3-8 in the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Panama, Bangladesh, Lebanon, the Philippines, Thailand, and Turkey given either one or two doses of QIV or active comparator (hep A)
    * Two doses of QIV 28 days apart if they were not considered "primed" by natural infection or previous vaccination, one dose if they were considered primed 
  * Serum samples collected 28 days after vaccination, passive surveillance for ILI with influenza PCR confirmation 
  * Analysis:
    * "Total effect" of vaccination against influenza virus comprised of "indirect effect" mediated by immune marker like HAI titer and "direct effect" mediated by other protective immune mechanisms 
    * Total effect estimated with **proportional hazards model** with time between last dose of vaccination and infection as outcome 
    * Direct effect (hazard ratio for QIV) estimated in three steps: 
      1) **Logistic regression** with vaccination status as outcome and log HAI titers, age, region, and priming status as predictors 
      2) Coefficients from step 1 are used to predict odds ratio of vaccination for each participant and weights for vaccinated participants constructed as inverse of these odds ratios 
      3) **Weighted proportional hazards** model fitted with outcome being time between vaccination and infection with covariates age, vaccine status, region, and priming status, and weights from step 2 used as regression weights 
    * Indirect effect calculated as ratio of total and direct effects
